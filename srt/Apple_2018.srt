00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:38,250
Whatever it is, I'm sure that

200
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,485
it's going to change the world.

201
00:08:40,485 --> 00:08:43,020
At Apple, changing the world and

202
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,890
making it a better place is what

203
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,459
it's all about for us.

204
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,127
We aim to put the customer at

205
00:08:49,127 --> 00:08:51,597
the center of everything that we

206
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:53,031
do.

207
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,500
That's why, together with you,

208
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,102
the developer community, we're

209
00:08:57,102 --> 00:09:00,472
working hard to provide new and

210
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:02,240
better experiences for our

Today is all about software, and

217
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:17,122
we've got some very exciting

We're going to get started with

iOS.

222
00:09:25,564 --> 00:09:26,965
IOS embodies our philosophy of

223
00:09:26,965 --> 00:09:28,233
putting the customer at the

224
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,035
center of everything that we

225
00:09:30,035 --> 00:09:31,670
design.

226
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:34,473
Every year, we deliver a major

To tell you all about what we

231
00:09:43,415 --> 00:09:45,517
had planned for this year, I'd

All right.

239
00:09:59,364 --> 00:10:02,834
The next release of iOS is, you

240
00:10:02,834 --> 00:10:05,504
guessed it, iOS 12.

241
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,407
Now, our customers, of course,

242
00:10:08,407 --> 00:10:11,043
are going to receive iOS 12 as a

243
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,311
free software update.

244
00:10:13,311 --> 00:10:15,480
Now, it's easy to forget now,

245
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,516
but iOS pioneered this approach

246
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:18,817
of helping you get more out of

247
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,752
the device you already own

248
00:10:20,752 --> 00:10:22,254
through free updates.

249
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,121
And some of those updates have

250
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:25,323
been really quite profound.

00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,125

00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,127
whole new way to discover and

00:11:06,331 --> 00:11:07,833
were introduced as far back as

00:14:57,228 --> 00:14:59,164
Now if this is all we'd done in

388
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,398
iOS 12, I think it would be a

389
00:15:00,398 --> 00:15:02,067
great release, but we've done

390
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:02,968
more.

391
00:15:02,968 --> 00:15:04,069
Much more.

392
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,236
And we have a lot to cover

393
00:15:05,236 --> 00:15:08,139
today, and it starts with

394
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:09,274
augmented reality.

395
00:15:09,274 --> 00:15:10,041
Yeah. [applause and cheering]

396
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:15,347
Now AR is transformational

397
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:16,348
technology.

398
00:15:16,348 --> 00:15:18,316
By bringing experiences into the

399
00:15:18,316 --> 00:15:21,086
real world, it enables all kinds

400
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:22,487
of new experiences, changing the

401
00:15:22,487 --> 00:15:24,589
way we have fun and the way we

402
00:15:24,589 --> 00:15:27,258
work, and in iOS 12, we wanted

403
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:28,660
to make an easy way to

404
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,429
experience AR across the system,

405
00:15:31,429 --> 00:15:33,064
and to do that, we got together

406
00:15:33,064 --> 00:15:34,666
with some of the greatest minds

407
00:15:34,666 --> 00:15:38,036
in 3D at Pixar, and together we

408
00:15:38,036 --> 00:15:40,405
created a new file format for

409
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,206
AR.

410
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,341
It's called USDZ, and it's a

411
00:15:43,341 --> 00:15:45,844
compact, single-file format

412
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:48,013
that's optimized for sharing

413
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:49,481
while retaining great 3D

414
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:52,283
graphics and even animations.

415
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:55,053
Now, you can use USDZ across the

416
00:15:55,053 --> 00:15:57,155
system from the files app, to

417
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,057
Safari, even sharing them over

418
00:15:59,057 --> 00:16:00,859
messages and mail, and what's

419
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,494
great is you can place these 3D

420
00:16:02,494 --> 00:16:04,896
objects into the real world.

421
00:16:04,896 --> 00:16:06,798
It's something that's like AR

422
00:16:06,798 --> 00:16:07,665
quick look.

423
00:16:07,665 --> 00:16:09,367
It's really awesome.

424
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,836
Now, we want all kinds of

425
00:16:11,836 --> 00:16:13,338
creatives to be able to create

426
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,507
content for AR, and so we're

427
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:16,541
working with the leading

428
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,310
companies for 3D tools and 3D

429
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:22,213
libraries to bring their support

430
00:16:22,213 --> 00:16:23,048
for USDZ.

431
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,117
Now one company that's been all

432
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:29,554
in on USDZ and ARKit is Adobe,

433
00:16:29,554 --> 00:16:30,722
and to tell you about what

434
00:16:30,722 --> 00:16:31,956
they're up to, I'd like to

435
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,892
invite Abhay Parasnis, their

436
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:36,027
CTO, to the stage.

437
00:16:36,027 --> 00:16:37,495
Abhay.

438
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:41,032
[ Applause ]

439
00:16:41,032 --> 00:16:41,866
Thanks Craig.

440
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:45,804
It's great to be here this morn.

441
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:48,006
So at Adobe we believe augmented

442
00:16:48,006 --> 00:16:49,941
reality is an incredibly

443
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,043
important technology.

444
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:54,746
And with ARKit, Apple is by far

445
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:56,648
the most powerful platform for

446
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:58,349
AR.

447
00:16:58,349 --> 00:16:59,818
So earlier Craig talked about

448
00:16:59,818 --> 00:17:01,553
USDZ format.

449
00:17:01,553 --> 00:17:02,754
It's actually a pretty big deal.

450
00:17:02,754 --> 00:17:05,857
There is now a way to deliver AR

451
00:17:05,857 --> 00:17:08,292
experiences across the entire

452
00:17:08,292 --> 00:17:10,327
iOS experience.

453
00:17:10,328 --> 00:17:13,263
And so today we are actually

454
00:17:13,263 --> 00:17:15,332
announcing that we are going to

455
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:17,602
bring native USDZ support to

456
00:17:17,602 --> 00:17:19,471
Adobe's Creative Cloud.

457
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:23,374
[ Applause ]

458
00:17:23,374 --> 00:17:26,077
With Creative Cloud, designers

459
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:28,046
and developers will now be able

460
00:17:28,046 --> 00:17:30,648
to use familiar apps, apps that

461
00:17:30,648 --> 00:17:31,850
they know and love, like

462
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,852
Photoshop or Dimension, to

463
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,421
create amazing AR content and

464
00:17:36,421 --> 00:17:38,556
bring it easily via USDZ.

465
00:17:38,556 --> 00:17:41,493
And of course, we are not going

466
00:17:41,493 --> 00:17:42,894
to stop there.

467
00:17:42,894 --> 00:17:44,329
We are going to bring the power

468
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:46,164
of immersive design to Creative

469
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:48,700
Cloud with a new set of services

470
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,702
and applications including a

471
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,071
brand-new iOS application that's

472
00:17:53,071 --> 00:17:55,306
going to let all of you design

473
00:17:55,306 --> 00:17:58,042
amazing AR experiences quickly.

474
00:17:58,042 --> 00:18:00,445
So, you will be able to bring in

475
00:18:00,445 --> 00:18:04,149
images, videos, text, any object

476
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,518
from Creative Cloud directly

477
00:18:06,518 --> 00:18:09,354
into a native AR environment.

478
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,656
In fact, for the first time with

479
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:14,058
Creative Cloud and iOS, you will

480
00:18:14,058 --> 00:18:16,361
have a what you see is what you

481
00:18:16,361 --> 00:18:18,863
get editing in AR.

482
00:18:18,863 --> 00:18:20,031
It's pretty cool.

483
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,503
So, come join this afternoon

484
00:18:25,503 --> 00:18:26,704

485
00:18:26,704 --> 00:18:28,206
able to give you a sneak peak of

some of these new immersive

487
00:18:29,607 --> 00:18:31,876
design tools for the first time.

Thank you, Abhay.

491
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,518
[applause] Now a critical part

492
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,787
of enabling AR is accurate

493
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,722
measurement, and fortunately the

494
00:18:44,722 --> 00:18:46,925
precise calibration of sensors

495
00:18:46,925 --> 00:18:49,027
in iOS devices and our tight

496
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:50,995
hardware software integration

497
00:18:50,995 --> 00:18:52,430
mean that we do this really

498
00:18:52,430 --> 00:18:54,032
well, and we want to enable

499
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,767
everyone to take advantage of

500
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,068
this capability.

501
00:18:57,068 --> 00:18:59,837
So we're introducing a new app,

502
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,306
and it's called Measure.

503
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,441
It makes it really easy to

504
00:19:03,441 --> 00:19:05,143
measure objects, detect

505
00:19:05,143 --> 00:19:06,344
rectangles and get their

506
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:08,146
dimensions, and measure lines

507
00:19:08,146 --> 00:19:09,814
along surfaces, and I'd like to

508
00:19:09,814 --> 00:19:10,848
show it to you now.

509
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:15,753
[applause] Now, in looking for

510
00:19:15,753 --> 00:19:18,289
something to measure, I ended up

511
00:19:18,289 --> 00:19:21,726
digging through the attic and

512
00:19:21,726 --> 00:19:24,896
came upon my old suitcase from

513
00:19:24,896 --> 00:19:27,765
my traveling days in college.

514
00:19:27,765 --> 00:19:30,268
A lot of memories in here.

515
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:32,370
Now I'm actually in the Measure

516
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,472
app, and you see I can easily

517
00:19:34,472 --> 00:19:37,408
measure along this suitcase by

518
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:41,713
just tapping and dragging out a

519
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,115
line, like that, and check that

520
00:19:44,115 --> 00:19:44,983
out.

521
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,718
It's a measurement.

522
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:50,021
[applause] Now, what's really

523
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,856
cool is I can extend these

524
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:55,059
measurements so I can just tap,

525
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,128
drag along another edge just

526
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:59,931
like that, and even take it into

527
00:19:59,931 --> 00:20:03,668
full 3D by dragging down to the

528
00:20:03,668 --> 00:20:05,236
bottom like that.

529
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:06,504
Isn't that cool?

530
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:11,376
[ Applause ]

531
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:12,310
Now I mentioned that we could

532
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,312
automatically detect rectangles

533
00:20:14,312 --> 00:20:15,680
and show you dimensions of

534
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,547
objects.

535
00:20:16,547 --> 00:20:18,316
So I have a photo here actually.

536
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,684
It's one my mom always wanted me

537
00:20:19,684 --> 00:20:22,520
to travel with of me as a baby,

538
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,157
and so, you see, what I can do

539
00:20:26,157 --> 00:20:27,759
with Measure is it automatically

540
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,127
detects the dimensions of that

541
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:29,927
photo.

542
00:20:29,927 --> 00:20:33,031
I can just tap and get, oh,

543
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,399
yeah, a cute little baby, wasn't

544
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,199
I?

545
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,767
And you can get measurements

546
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:36,467
just like that.

547
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:37,535
It's really fantastic.

[ Applause ]

549
00:20:41,539 --> 00:20:44,075
Now, I'd like to turn now to

550
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:46,411
USDZ and its support throughout

551
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,312
the system.

552
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:48,880
You know, you can experience

553
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,481
USDZ in so many places, and one

554
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,250
of those places is news.

555
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,484
Now here's an article.

556
00:20:53,484 --> 00:20:54,519
We're all accustomed to seeing

557
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,220
images in news articles.

558
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,689
But check this out.

559
00:20:57,689 --> 00:20:59,524
Here you see a USDZ asset.

560
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:00,658
It can just tap on this little

561
00:21:00,658 --> 00:21:03,494
3D control and jump right in and

562
00:21:03,494 --> 00:21:04,228
experience it.

563
00:21:04,228 --> 00:21:05,129
You can see the amazing

564
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,931
animations that are possible,

565
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:07,832
and of course it's fully

566
00:21:07,832 --> 00:21:09,233
interactive.

567
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:12,870
So I can zoom in and pan.

568
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,039
Isn't that amazing?

569
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,545
[applause] Now USDZ is also

570
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:21,646
great in the web.

571
00:21:21,646 --> 00:21:23,147
So here I am at the Fender

572
00:21:23,147 --> 00:21:24,449
website and actually let you

573
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,817
configure your guitar with the

574
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,151
kind of finish and pickguard

575
00:21:27,151 --> 00:21:27,985
that you want.

576
00:21:27,985 --> 00:21:29,620
So I can select a configuration

577
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,389
option here, and then I can see

578
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:32,857
the guitar I've configured.

579
00:21:32,857 --> 00:21:34,325
So I'm just going to tap in.

580
00:21:34,325 --> 00:21:36,260
Of course I can see the guitar

581
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,862
here, but wouldn't it be cool if

582
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:39,430
I could see it in the real world

583
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,632
in its real size?

584
00:21:41,632 --> 00:21:42,400
Well, there it is.

00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,234
Check that out.

586
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:44,035

587
00:21:44,035 --> 00:21:51,709
capture that for posterity.

588

And that's a quick look at USDZ

589
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:57,448
and Measure in iOS 12.

590
00:21:57,448 --> 00:22:00,118
Next-- thank you.

[applause] Next, I'd like to

592
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,789
talk about the key technology

593
00:22:04,789 --> 00:22:06,557
behind these augmented reality

594
00:22:06,557 --> 00:22:09,227
experiences, and that's ARKit.

595
00:22:09,227 --> 00:22:11,129
ARKit opens up the world of AR

596
00:22:11,129 --> 00:22:13,030
to hundreds of millions of

597
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,999
users, making it the world's

598
00:22:14,999 --> 00:22:18,836
largest AR platform by far.

599
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:20,805
And we're on a relentless pace

600
00:22:20,805 --> 00:22:22,640
of advancement with AR, and that

601
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,778
continues today with ARKit 2.

602
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:31,516
Yes. ARKit 2 delivers advances

603
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,651
with improved face tracking,

604
00:22:33,651 --> 00:22:35,486
more realistic rendering, and

605
00:22:35,486 --> 00:22:38,156
support for 3D object detection

606
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,957
and persistence, which enables

launching into AR experiences

613
00:22:50,835 --> 00:22:52,603
foundation for a lesson that was

authored in AR.

615

Now, check out how both players

628
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:20,431
and even a third observer can

629
00:23:20,431 --> 00:23:21,666
all experience the same

labs over the last couple of

636
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,747
weeks to work with ARKit, and

00:23:36,747 --> 00:23:37,582
they love it.

638

Now, one of them is Lego.

expand those creative

physical and digital together to

659
00:24:20,825 --> 00:24:22,126
really open up those creative

00:24:22,126 --> 00:24:23,995
play possibilities, because our

661
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:25,663
Lego sets are really the start

662
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:26,731

00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,804
it to the next level.

could take things even further?

675
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:49,921
Well now with 3D object

766
00:27:33,017 --> 00:27:36,387
Perfect, we did it.

767
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,489
Yeah. What?

768
00:27:38,489 --> 00:27:42,426
[ Applause ]

769
00:27:42,426 --> 00:27:44,295
And we've even unlocked a new

770
00:27:44,295 --> 00:27:46,464
item for our collection.

771
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:47,631
But the fun doesn't need to end

772
00:27:47,631 --> 00:27:50,201
there because with ARKit 2, we

773
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,404
get to save our entire world

774
00:27:53,404 --> 00:27:56,140
back into our physical set and

775
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:58,375
pick up where we left off.

776
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,045
[applause] All right.

777
00:28:01,045 --> 00:28:01,746
That's awesome.

778
00:28:01,746 --> 00:28:03,814
So much fun.

779
00:28:03,814 --> 00:28:05,216
But what makes this truly

780
00:28:05,216 --> 00:28:06,884
amazing is how with just a

781
00:28:06,884 --> 00:28:09,420
single Lego creation and ARKit 2

782
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,488
it really opens up those

783
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:12,556
creative play possibilities.

784
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:14,391
So look out for more Lego AR

785
00:28:14,391 --> 00:28:16,393
experiences in the App Store

786
00:28:16,393 --> 00:28:17,228
later this year.

787
00:28:17,228 --> 00:28:18,462
Thank you very much everybody.

788
00:28:18,462 --> 00:28:22,166
[ Applause ]

789
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:23,901
Isn't that great?

790
00:28:23,901 --> 00:28:25,870
So that's our update on AR and

791
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,104
iOS 12.

792
00:28:27,104 --> 00:28:28,806
Next, I'd like to turn to

793
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:29,840
Photos.

794
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,543
You know, over a trillion photos

795
00:28:32,543 --> 00:28:34,612
are captured on iPhone each

796
00:28:34,612 --> 00:28:38,549
year, and Photos is the best way

797
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:41,051
to relive and share those

798
00:28:41,051 --> 00:28:42,520
moments.

799
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,054
This year we're making photos

800
00:28:44,054 --> 00:28:45,890
even better, and it starts with

801
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,024
Search.

802
00:28:47,024 --> 00:28:49,193
Search has powerful object and

803
00:28:49,193 --> 00:28:50,594
scene recognition.

804
00:28:50,594 --> 00:28:51,762
It lets you search for photos

805
00:28:51,762 --> 00:28:53,097
based on things like searching

806
00:28:53,097 --> 00:28:55,699
for cars or dogs or flowers, and

807
00:28:55,699 --> 00:28:56,834
that's a great way to explore

808
00:28:56,834 --> 00:28:59,470
your library, but in iOS 12,

809
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:01,372
Search now starts working for

810
00:29:01,372 --> 00:29:04,208
you even before you start typing

811
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,143
with Search suggestions.

812
00:29:06,143 --> 00:29:07,411
It'll highlight things for you

813
00:29:07,411 --> 00:29:09,814
like key moments and people that

814
00:29:09,814 --> 00:29:11,982
are important to you, places

815
00:29:11,982 --> 00:29:13,150
where you've taken some great

816
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,451
photos and even categories of

817
00:29:14,451 --> 00:29:16,720
photos like hiking and water

818
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,555
sports.

819
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:19,456
And Search is much more powerful

820
00:29:19,456 --> 00:29:20,324
than ever.

821
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:21,625
You can search for places by

822
00:29:21,625 --> 00:29:22,493
business name.

823
00:29:22,493 --> 00:29:23,661
So you could search for SFMOMA

824
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,130
or even a broad category like

825
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:27,464
museum.

826
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:30,467
And, Photos indexes over four

827
00:29:30,467 --> 00:29:32,303
million events by time and

828
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:33,137
place.

829
00:29:33,137 --> 00:29:34,505
Things like sporting events and

830
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:36,006
concerts, and so you can search

831
00:29:36,006 --> 00:29:37,708
for them and find photos you

832
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:39,443
took at those events.

833
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,212
And search is super powerful.

834
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:42,313
You can now search for multiple

835
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:44,481
search terms like surfing and

836
00:29:44,481 --> 00:29:45,816
vacation and even get

837
00:29:45,816 --> 00:29:47,718
suggestions for additional

838
00:29:47,718 --> 00:29:49,186
search terms to help you find

839
00:29:49,186 --> 00:29:50,955
exactly what you're looking for.

840
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,790
And now in iOS 12 we have an all

841
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,858
new tab.

842
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,893
It's called For You.

843
00:29:55,893 --> 00:29:58,162
And with For You, you have all

844
00:29:58,162 --> 00:29:59,396
of your memories, so those great

845
00:29:59,396 --> 00:30:01,632
memory movies, but more like

846
00:30:01,632 --> 00:30:03,500
featured photos highlighting a

847
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,636
photo that you took on this day

848
00:30:05,636 --> 00:30:07,104
in past years.

849
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,506
And Effects Suggestions, for

850
00:30:09,506 --> 00:30:11,108
instance, suggesting looping a

851
00:30:11,108 --> 00:30:14,011
live photo or applying a new

852
00:30:14,011 --> 00:30:15,646
portrait effect to one of your

853
00:30:15,646 --> 00:30:16,981
portrait photos.

854
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,282
And we even highlight your

855
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,551
shared album activity.

856
00:30:20,551 --> 00:30:22,253
Now when it comes to sharing,

857
00:30:22,253 --> 00:30:23,254
there are many ways you can

858
00:30:23,254 --> 00:30:25,556
share photos, but our focus is

859
00:30:25,556 --> 00:30:27,558
on sharing great photos with the

860
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:29,627
people you care about most, and

861
00:30:29,627 --> 00:30:31,362
that's why this year in For You

862
00:30:31,362 --> 00:30:33,731
we've added Sharing Suggestions.

863
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,633
So imagine you've gone out for a

864
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:36,867
great dinner with some friends

865
00:30:36,867 --> 00:30:38,102
and you took some photos.

866
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:40,037
Well afterwards in For You,

867
00:30:40,037 --> 00:30:41,438
you'll see a suggestion like

868
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:42,907
this to share those photos.

869
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,042
If you tap in, you'll see that

870
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:47,511
photos is even recommending a

871
00:30:47,511 --> 00:30:50,114
set of photos from that set that

872
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,216
you might want to share and

873
00:30:52,216 --> 00:30:53,684
suggest who you might want to

874
00:30:53,684 --> 00:30:55,686
share them with based in part by

875
00:30:55,686 --> 00:30:57,054
the people that appeared in the

876
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:57,955
photos.

877
00:30:57,955 --> 00:30:59,189
And when you share them, they're

878
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:01,225
shared at full resolution out of

879
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:04,528
your iCloud photo library and

880
00:31:04,528 --> 00:31:05,529
when you're friend receives

881
00:31:05,529 --> 00:31:07,231
them, something really magical

882
00:31:07,231 --> 00:31:07,998
happens.

883
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:09,300
Their phone searches their

884
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,801
libraries for other photos they

885
00:31:10,801 --> 00:31:12,536
took at that event and suggest

886
00:31:12,536 --> 00:31:13,871
that they share them back to

887
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,739
you, so you both can end up with

888
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:16,507
a full set.

889
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:23,047
[ Applause ]

890
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,315
Now this is built around

891
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:25,482
iMessage so of course it's

892
00:31:25,482 --> 00:31:26,850
private, using end-to-end

893
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,786
encryption, and all of those

894
00:31:28,786 --> 00:31:30,888
smarts are done with on-device

895
00:31:30,888 --> 00:31:32,089
machine learning.

896
00:31:32,089 --> 00:31:33,857
So that's your quick update on

897
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:37,127
Photos in iOS 12, and next,

898
00:31:37,127 --> 00:31:39,129
let's turn to Siri.

899
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:40,965
Now Siri is by far the world's

900
00:31:40,965 --> 00:31:43,233
most used digital assistant with

901
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:45,169
over 10 billion requests

902
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:47,237
processed per month, and because

903
00:31:47,237 --> 00:31:48,806
Siri works across all your

904
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,874
devices, it's always there to

905
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:51,976
help you through your day

906
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:53,777
getting things done.

907
00:31:53,777 --> 00:31:56,280
Now we all know that Siri works

908
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,315
with many third-party apps for

909
00:31:58,315 --> 00:32:00,317
things like messaging, ride

910
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:02,586
sharing, and payments.

911
00:32:02,586 --> 00:32:03,921
But we wanted to make Siri able

912
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,923
to do much more for you, and

913
00:32:05,923 --> 00:32:07,491
we're doing that by taking

914
00:32:07,491 --> 00:32:09,326
advantage of the power of apps

915
00:32:09,326 --> 00:32:11,095
with a new feature we call

916
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,529
Shortcuts.

917
00:32:12,529 --> 00:32:14,565
Now with shortcuts any app can

918
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,267
expose quick actions to Siri.

919
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:19,103
Let's look at some examples.

920
00:32:19,103 --> 00:32:20,738
Now say you have the Tile app

921
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:22,106
because you're always losing

922
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,307
your keys.

923
00:32:23,307 --> 00:32:25,242
Well, the Tile app can expose

924
00:32:25,242 --> 00:32:27,444
the option to add a shortcut to

925
00:32:27,444 --> 00:32:28,245
Siri.

926
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:30,247
And you can assign your own

927
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,216
phrase, such as I lost my keys

928
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,584
would be a good choice, and when

929
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:36,020
you then say it, Siri will

930
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,856
automatically activate Tile and

931
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:40,257
show you right in the Siri UI

932
00:32:40,257 --> 00:32:42,092
start ringing your Tile just

933
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:42,726
like that.

934
00:32:42,726 --> 00:32:43,694
It's really great.

935
00:32:43,694 --> 00:32:44,528
[applause]

936
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:48,132
[ Applause ]

937
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:49,700
Of course there's so many uses

938
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,634
for this kind of thing.

939
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,302
You could say game time to get

940
00:32:52,302 --> 00:32:53,871
your team's schedule from

941
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,206
TeamSnap or help me relax to

942
00:32:56,206 --> 00:32:58,509
kick off a meditation or order

943
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,711
my groceries to order your

944
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:01,578
usual.

945
00:33:01,578 --> 00:33:03,881
You know, with millions of apps,

946
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:05,516
Shortcut enables incredible

947
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:07,051
possibilities for how you use

948
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,118
Siri.

949
00:33:08,118 --> 00:33:10,721
Now, as you know, Siri is more

950
00:33:10,721 --> 00:33:11,555
than just a voice.

951
00:33:11,555 --> 00:33:12,923
Siri is working all the time in

952
00:33:12,923 --> 00:33:14,358
the background to make proactive

953
00:33:14,358 --> 00:33:16,260
suggestions for you even before

954
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:20,164
you ask, and now with Shortcut,

955
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,032
Siri can do so much more.

956
00:33:22,032 --> 00:33:23,400
So, for instance, let's say you

957
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,035
order a coffee every morning at

958
00:33:25,035 --> 00:33:27,104
Phil's before you go to work.

959
00:33:27,104 --> 00:33:28,839
Well now, Siri can suggest right

960
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:30,340
on your lock screen that you do

961
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,175
that.

962
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,709
You tap on it, and you can place

963
00:33:32,709 --> 00:33:35,179
the order right from there.

964
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:36,747
Or if when you get to the gym

965
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,115
you use Active to track

966
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:40,150
workouts, well that suggestion

967
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,685
will appear right on your lock

968
00:33:41,685 --> 00:33:42,519
screen.

969
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:43,454
And this even works when you

970
00:33:43,454 --> 00:33:44,888
pull down into Search.

971
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:46,323
You'll get great suggestions.

972
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,891
Like say you're running late for

973
00:33:47,891 --> 00:33:49,359
a meeting, well Siri will

974
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:50,961
suggest you text the meeting

975
00:33:50,961 --> 00:33:51,762
organizer.

976
00:33:51,762 --> 00:33:54,031
Or when you go to the movie,

977
00:33:54,031 --> 00:33:55,632
suggest that you turn on Do Not

978
00:33:55,632 --> 00:33:56,467
Disturb.

979
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:58,302
That's just being considerate.

980
00:33:58,302 --> 00:34:01,038
And remind you to call grandma

981
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:01,839
on her birthday.

982
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,307
Just tap, and it'll dial the

983
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,808
call for you.

984
00:34:04,808 --> 00:34:06,243
Now, we think we're all going to

985
00:34:06,243 --> 00:34:08,679
really enjoy using Shortcuts,

986
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,313
and so we went a step further.

987
00:34:10,313 --> 00:34:11,581
We wanted to let you create your

988
00:34:11,581 --> 00:34:15,218
own shortcuts as users, multiple

989
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,587
steps across multiple

990
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,722
applications, and we're doing it

991
00:34:18,722 --> 00:34:22,159
with a new Shortcuts app.

992
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,694
So with the Shortcuts app, you

993
00:34:23,694 --> 00:34:25,829
could do something like create a

994
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:27,998
shortcut for surf time, and it

995
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:29,132
could go get you the surf

996
00:34:29,132 --> 00:34:30,933
report, look up the current

997
00:34:30,934 --> 00:34:33,070
weather, get you the ETA to the

998
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,404
beach, and even create a

999
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:35,739
reminder for you to put on

1000
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:37,808
sunscreen when you get there.

1001
00:34:37,808 --> 00:34:40,543
Now, it's all done with simple

1002
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:43,012
drag and drop steps in the

1003
00:34:43,013 --> 00:34:45,748
Shortcuts editor right here.

1004
00:34:45,748 --> 00:34:47,116
It's really easy.

1005
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:48,452
Now to show you how Shortcuts

1006
00:34:48,452 --> 00:34:50,087
can streamline your day, I'd

1007
00:34:50,087 --> 00:34:50,920
like to invite one of our

1008
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,955

1010

1011
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:57,227
you a live demo.

1012
00:34:57,227 --> 00:34:57,661
Kim.

1013
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:58,529
Hey!

1014
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:05,536
[ Applause ]

1015
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,504
I'm am so stoked to show you

1016
00:35:07,504 --> 00:35:08,672
Siri Shortcuts.

1017
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,706
To do that, I'm going to walk

1018
00:35:09,706 --> 00:35:10,841
you through my day.

1019
00:35:10,841 --> 00:35:12,009
So imagine it's the morning.

1020
00:35:12,009 --> 00:35:13,343
I'm headed to work, and I pick

1021
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,612
up my phone, and I see this

1022
00:35:15,612 --> 00:35:17,681
suggestion from Phil's Coffee.

1023
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:19,116
Siri has learned that I do this

1024
00:35:19,116 --> 00:35:20,717
most mornings, so now I can just

1025
00:35:20,717 --> 00:35:22,920
tap on the suggestion and I see

1026
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,054
all the details I need to

1027
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:26,023
confirm my perfect Mint Monkey

1028
00:35:26,023 --> 00:35:27,291
Dough right here on the lock

1029
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,592
screen without even going into

1030
00:35:28,592 --> 00:35:29,359
the app.

1031
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,994
So let's get caffeinated.

1032
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:33,797
And I'm done.

1033
00:35:33,797 --> 00:35:36,633
Fast forward a little bit, and

1034
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,001
I'm sitting at my desk at my

1035
00:35:38,001 --> 00:35:39,236
office and I need to know when

1036
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:40,504
my next meeting is.

1037
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:41,705
I'll go to the Up Next widget,

1038
00:35:41,705 --> 00:35:43,640
and it looks like I am running a

1039
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,841
little late for a rather

1040
00:35:44,841 --> 00:35:46,777
important meeting, so I should

1041
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:48,412
probably let someone know.

1042
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:49,846
And it looks like Shortcuts is a

1043
00:35:49,846 --> 00:35:50,881
few steps ahead of me.

1044
00:35:50,881 --> 00:35:52,182
I could call into the meeting,

1045
00:35:52,182 --> 00:35:53,650
or I could let the organizer

1046
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,152
know that I am running late.

1047
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:56,220
I should probably tell Arie

1048
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,588
what's up.

1049
00:35:57,588 --> 00:35:58,555
That looks like just what I want

1050
00:35:58,555 --> 00:36:01,692
to say, sorry Arie, let's send

1051
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,393
it.

1052
00:36:03,393 --> 00:36:05,896
Perfect. I also want to show you

1053
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:07,664
how you can add a shortcut to

1054
00:36:07,664 --> 00:36:08,498
Siri.

1055
00:36:08,498 --> 00:36:09,866
So let's take a look at Kayak.

1056
00:36:09,866 --> 00:36:12,703
I keep all of my travel details

1057
00:36:12,703 --> 00:36:13,537
in Kayak.

1058
00:36:13,537 --> 00:36:15,205
Most important is my post WWDC

1059
00:36:15,205 --> 00:36:18,275
relaxation trip to Los Angeles.

1060
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,876
You can see I have got my

1061
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,712
flight, my hotel, all the

1062
00:36:21,712 --> 00:36:23,313
details, everything I need, but

1063
00:36:23,313 --> 00:36:24,781
what I really want is to be able

1064
00:36:24,781 --> 00:36:26,049
to use this and get to this

1065
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:27,851
information with my voice while

1066
00:36:27,851 --> 00:36:29,119
I'm on the go.

1067
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:31,221
So, let's head back, and I can

1068
00:36:31,221 --> 00:36:33,991
just tap add to Siri, record my

1069
00:36:33,991 --> 00:36:36,927
custom phrase, travel plans

1070
00:36:36,927 --> 00:36:40,530
[beep], and I'm done.

1071
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:42,766
So now when I land at the

1072
00:36:42,766 --> 00:36:44,434
airport and I'm about to get in

1073
00:36:44,434 --> 00:36:45,969
a cab and I could really use

1074
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:47,838
that hotel address, I can just

1075
00:36:47,838 --> 00:36:52,509
say, travel plans.

1076
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:54,344
Kayak says your hotel is at

1077
00:36:54,344 --> 00:36:56,713
929 South Broadway.

1078
00:36:56,713 --> 00:36:58,248
You can check in after 3 p.m.

1079
00:36:58,248 --> 00:36:59,750
Isn't that cool?

1080
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,451
[applause] It's pretty cool.

1081
00:37:01,451 --> 00:37:06,990
[ Applause ]

1082
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,091
So I would love to be on that

1083
00:37:08,091 --> 00:37:09,393
vacation, but I should, I don't

1084
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,028
know, probably finish this demo,

1085
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,030
so let's head back to work, and

1086
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,231
I can show you how the Shortcut

1087
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:15,666
app can help me with my commute

1088
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,068
home.

1089
00:37:18,068 --> 00:37:19,803
We start in the Gallery where

1090
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:21,071
there's hundreds of premade

1091
00:37:21,071 --> 00:37:22,973
shortcuts that you can download,

1092
00:37:22,973 --> 00:37:23,907
or we can hop over to the

1093
00:37:23,907 --> 00:37:25,409
library, and I've got a bunch of

1094
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,510
shortcuts here, but I want to

1095
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,711
show you my heading home

1096
00:37:27,711 --> 00:37:28,912
shortcut.

1097
00:37:28,912 --> 00:37:31,214
You can see that it's just

1098
00:37:31,214 --> 00:37:32,749
really a series of steps.

1099
00:37:32,749 --> 00:37:34,518
It grabs my location and travel

1100
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,553
time, and it sends my ETA to my

1101
00:37:36,553 --> 00:37:38,021
roommate.

1102
00:37:38,021 --> 00:37:39,523
It sets my HomeKit thermostat to

1103
00:37:39,523 --> 00:37:40,991
70 degrees, and it turns on my

1104
00:37:40,991 --> 00:37:41,958
fan.

1105
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:43,327
And last, it gets directions

1106
00:37:43,327 --> 00:37:44,594
home with Apple maps with the

1107
00:37:44,594 --> 00:37:46,363
best route to avoid traffic.

1108
00:37:46,363 --> 00:37:48,632
Now this is already pretty cool,

1109
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:50,801
but I happen to be an NPR News

1110
00:37:50,801 --> 00:37:52,402
junkie, so I should probably

1111
00:37:52,402 --> 00:37:53,737
just add that to my shortcut to

1112
00:37:53,737 --> 00:37:55,038
save me some trouble on the ride

1113
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:55,872
home.

1114
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:58,141
Let's tap search, and there's a

1115
00:37:58,141 --> 00:37:59,676
bunch I can add here, but I can

1116
00:37:59,676 --> 00:38:02,045
just tap Siri suggestions, and

1117
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,181
there it is, play KQED Radio,

1118
00:38:04,181 --> 00:38:07,184
we'll drag this in, drop it, and

1119
00:38:07,184 --> 00:38:08,885
we're set.

1120
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:10,387
I've already added the shortcut

1121
00:38:10,387 --> 00:38:12,089
to Siri with a custom phrase,

1122
00:38:12,089 --> 00:38:14,391
heading home, so now, whenever I

1123
00:38:14,391 --> 00:38:16,793
leave work, I can just say,

1124
00:38:16,793 --> 00:38:18,161
heading home.

1125
00:38:18,161 --> 00:38:22,532

Your thermostat is set to 70

00:38:55,832 --> 00:38:56,800
of course you can run your

so great to be here.

our most popular apps, starting

1157
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:28,331
with one of my favorites, News.

1158
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:32,002
So News is a personalized feed

discover new channels and

easier to jump to your favorites

We've added a new sidebar, and

00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,439
it's a great way to navigate.

1175
00:40:09,439 --> 00:40:12,843
It makes it easy and I fun to

take a moment to talk about

1283
00:43:53,763 --> 00:43:55,198
something that's on a lot of

1284

attention than we might even

1291
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:12,382
realize.

when we really should be

in for fear of missing out.

1299
00:44:23,059 --> 00:44:25,628
And some of us, it's become such

1300
00:44:25,628 --> 00:44:26,963

1301
00:44:26,963 --> 00:44:28,498
not even recognize just how

1302
00:44:28,498 --> 00:44:30,600

distraction, focus, and

1308
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:44,314
understand how you're spending

1309
00:44:44,314 --> 00:44:46,916
your time and balance the many

things that are important to

those, of course, is at night.

Sometimes you wake up in the

middle of the night, and you

1320
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:01,531
look at your phone, maybe just

1321
00:45:01,531 --> 00:45:02,832
to check the time, and you're

1322
00:45:02,832 --> 00:45:03,867
confronted with something like

1323

this, a barrage of notifications

1324
00:45:06,669 --> 00:45:08,204
that spin you up and keep you

1325
00:45:08,204 --> 00:45:10,273
from falling back asleep.

1326
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,408
And so we're introducing Do Not

1327
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:14,611
Disturb during bedtime where all

1328
00:45:14,611 --> 00:45:16,980
you'll see is this.

1329
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:18,615
Nothing to get you spun up.

1330
00:45:18,615 --> 00:45:20,483
And in the morning, yeah.

1331
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:26,489
[ Applause ]

1332
00:45:26,489 --> 00:45:27,957
In the morning when you wake up,

1333
00:45:27,957 --> 00:45:29,392
you're gently eased into your

1334
00:45:29,392 --> 00:45:30,193
day.

1335
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:31,027
You can tap when you want to

1336
00:45:31,027 --> 00:45:32,095
start confronting those

1337
00:45:32,095 --> 00:45:33,963
notifications.

1338
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,066
Now we've all found ourselves in

1339
00:45:37,066 --> 00:45:40,937
situations like this.

1340
00:45:40,937 --> 00:45:42,272
[laughter] Now, rest assured, he

1341
00:45:42,272 --> 00:45:44,440
stuck the landing on this one.

1342
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:47,544
But now Do Not Disturb can help,

1343
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:48,745
and we made it easier than ever

1344
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:49,946
to use Do Not Disturb because

1345
00:45:49,946 --> 00:45:51,347
now we have a great new mode

1346
00:45:51,347 --> 00:45:52,482
where when you press in to Do

1347
00:45:52,482 --> 00:45:54,651
Not Disturb and Control Center,

1348
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:56,052
you can set an ending time for

1349
00:45:56,052 --> 00:45:56,986
Do Not Disturb for when you

1350
00:45:56,986 --> 00:45:58,688
leave a particular location or

1351
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:00,023
when an event ends on your

1352
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:00,857
calendar.

1353
00:46:00,857 --> 00:46:01,658
So I think we're all going to be

1354
00:46:01,658 --> 00:46:03,159
using Do Not Disturb a bunch

1355
00:46:03,159 --> 00:46:04,060
more.

1356
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,029
Now next I want to talk about

1357
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:07,664
Notifications.

1358
00:46:07,664 --> 00:46:10,533
Now, Notifications help keep us

1359
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:11,701
informed and connected to

1360
00:46:11,701 --> 00:46:13,236
important things that happen

1361
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,371
throughout the day, and we'd

1362
00:46:15,371 --> 00:46:16,773
like to give you more control

1363
00:46:16,773 --> 00:46:19,075
over how many notifications you

1364
00:46:19,075 --> 00:46:21,411
receive, and so we're enabling

1365
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,946
what we call Instant Tuning for

1366
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,047
Notifications right from the

1367
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,415
lock screen.

1368
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:26,549
You can press in to a

1369
00:46:26,549 --> 00:46:28,051
notification, and from there,

1370
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:29,319
you can decide to send future

1371
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:31,221
notifications from that app

1372
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:32,655
directly to Notifications

00:46:32,655 --> 00:46:33,957

Or turn them off altogether, and

1376
00:46:36,826 --> 00:46:37,927
Siri will even help by

suggesting that you turn off

1378
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:41,030
Notifications for apps that

1379
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:42,832
you're no longer using.

1380
00:46:42,832 --> 00:46:44,634
Now, we also wanted to give you

1381
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:46,436
help managing large numbers of

1382
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:47,637
notifications.

1383
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:49,239
So I'm thrilled to announce that

1384
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:51,541
we're bringing to iOS support

1385
00:46:51,541 --> 00:46:53,509
for grouped notifications.

[ Applause ]

1387
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:03,119
Notifications are grouped not

1388
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:05,622
just by app but also by topic

1389
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:06,689
and thread.

1390
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:08,091
It gives you a great overview of

1391
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:08,958
the notifications you've

1392
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:09,959
received.

1393
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:11,594
You can tap in and look at a

1394
00:47:11,594 --> 00:47:12,629
particular group.

1395
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:15,064
But of course just as important

1396
00:47:15,064 --> 00:47:17,100
with a single swipe, you can

1397
00:47:17,100 --> 00:47:18,902
triage a whole group of

1398
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:20,303
notifications away.

1399
00:47:20,303 --> 00:47:22,472

1404
00:47:32,448 --> 00:47:34,050
further, and it's with a feature

1405
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,552
we call screen time.

1406
00:47:36,552 --> 00:47:39,088
Screen time empowers you with

1407
00:47:39,088 --> 00:47:41,357
both insight and control over

1408
00:47:41,357 --> 00:47:43,526
how you spend your time, and it

1409
00:47:43,526 --> 00:47:46,029
starts with reports.

1410
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,031
Every week, you get a weekly

1411
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:51,100
activity summary that details

1412
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:53,336
how you used your iPhone or

1413
00:47:53,336 --> 00:47:54,537

00:47:54,537 --> 00:47:56,472
You tap in, and you get to view

your full activity report.

1416
00:47:58,942 --> 00:47:59,976
It's really detailed.

1417
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:01,444
You get deep insight on how much

1418
00:48:01,444 --> 00:48:03,012
time you're spending, where

1419
00:48:03,012 --> 00:48:04,614
you're spending it, and even how

1420
00:48:04,614 --> 00:48:05,982
your use breaks down during the

1421
00:48:05,982 --> 00:48:09,085
day or the night.

1422
00:48:09,085 --> 00:48:10,787
You get a summary of the time

1423
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:12,922
you're spending in apps, how

1424
00:48:12,922 --> 00:48:15,291
much time you're spending, how

1425
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:16,893
often per hour you're picking up

1426
00:48:16,893 --> 00:48:18,094
your phone and what's drawing

1427
00:48:18,094 --> 00:48:20,964
you in and what apps are sending

1428
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,399
you the most notifications.

1429
00:48:23,399 --> 00:48:25,201
Now, equipped with this insight,

1430
00:48:25,201 --> 00:48:26,903
you can make decisions about how

1431
00:48:26,903 --> 00:48:28,304
much time you want to spend with

00:48:29,973 --> 00:48:31,040
But we know there are people who

1434
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:32,976
would like a little extra help

1435
00:48:32,976 --> 00:48:34,911
in managing their use of apps,

1436
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:36,612

Limits.

1438
00:48:37,647 --> 00:48:39,916
So if in your activity report

1439
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:41,317
you see an app where you might

1440
00:48:41,317 --> 00:48:42,251
want to be spending a little bit

1441
00:48:42,251 --> 00:48:44,921
less time, well you can set your

1442

own limit, and then during the

1443
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,425
day, when you're using the app,

1444
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:50,259
you receive a helpful

1448
00:49:02,038 --> 00:49:03,039
And once you've reached your

1449
00:49:03,039 --> 00:49:04,741
limit, instead of the app,

1450
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,075
you'll see this.

1451
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:07,643
It's time to move on.

1452
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:08,511
Now, we'll let you grant

1453
00:49:08,511 --> 00:49:09,679
yourself and extension if you

1454
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:11,314
want, but we'll give you a

1455
00:49:11,314 --> 00:49:12,982
reminder later to move along.

1456
00:49:12,982 --> 00:49:15,618
Now, this is also in sync across

1457
00:49:15,618 --> 00:49:16,919
your iPhone and iPad, so your

1458
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:18,721
limits apply to your total

1459
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:19,622
usage.

1460
00:49:19,622 --> 00:49:20,490
And we think this is going to be

1461
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:23,626
helpful for many people, but

1462
00:49:23,626 --> 00:49:26,195
especially for some kids.

1463
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,964
And we know this is something

1464
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,198
that can help families achieve

1465
00:49:29,198 --> 00:49:31,200
the right balance for them.

1466
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,435
And of course it starts with

1467
00:49:32,435 --> 00:49:33,803
providing your kids with great

1468

well on your device, and based

1472
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:44,580
on what you see, you have the

One of them is downtime, time

when you want your kids to

unplug altogether.

1481
00:50:06,135 --> 00:50:08,671
kids' time in apps by category

1482
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:11,040
or by individual app.

1483

Now, there's some apps you may

1484
00:50:12,208 --> 00:50:13,643
want to always allow them to

1485
00:50:13,643 --> 00:50:14,477
use.

1486
00:50:14,477 --> 00:50:15,311
For instance, you may want them

1487
00:50:15,311 --> 00:50:16,245
to be able to get at the phone

1488
00:50:16,245 --> 00:50:17,513
at all times, so they can

1489
00:50:17,513 --> 00:50:18,314
contact you.

1490
00:50:18,314 --> 00:50:19,315

access to educational apps.

1492
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,586

only movies, apps, and websites

1494

that you deem age appropriate.

to express ourselves with emoji

00:51:12,101 --> 00:51:14,237
things that make Animoji so fun

1514
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,705
is how expressive they are, you

1516
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,242

00:54:06,876 --> 00:54:08,044
is.

1590
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,845
I recently chopped my hair, so I

1591
00:54:09,845 --> 00:54:11,380
want one that matches the new

1593
00:54:12,615 --> 00:54:13,983
So I've selected a skin color,

1594
00:54:13,983 --> 00:54:16,319

1595
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,820

choose from.

First, I'm going to grab my

1603
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,036
color, and then like I said, I

1604
00:54:34,036 --> 00:54:36,539
need to go a little bit shorter.

1605
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,773

Nope, this is the one.

1608
00:54:42,611 --> 00:54:44,613
course select my eye color, and

1609
00:54:44,613 --> 00:54:46,182

Yeah. Facetime is the way that

1695
00:57:58,807 --> 00:58:00,175
so many of us connect with the

1696
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:01,710
people in our lives and share

1697
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,711
some of our most important

1698
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,480
moments, and it's helped us

1699
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,482
deepen our connect with people

1700
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:08,150
important to us wherever they

1701
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,052
are, and of course it's a fun

1702
00:58:10,052 --> 00:58:11,854
place just to hang out.

1703
00:58:11,854 --> 00:58:13,989
Now this year Facetime is going

1704
00:58:13,989 --> 00:58:16,725
to take a big leap forward

1705
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:19,895
because today we're introducing

1706
00:58:19,895 --> 00:58:22,464
Group Facetime.

1707
00:58:22,464 --> 00:58:28,037
[ Applause ]

1708
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:31,073
Now, you'll be able to facetime

1709
00:58:31,073 --> 00:58:34,944
with two people, three people,

1710
00:58:34,944 --> 00:58:38,480
actually up to 32 simultaneous

1711
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:39,481
participants.

[ Applause ]

1713
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:46,155
Now, setting up a group call

1714
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:47,590
couldn't be easier.

1715
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:48,591
Just instead of typing one

1716
00:58:48,591 --> 00:58:50,259
person's name, you can do many.

1717
00:58:50,259 --> 00:58:51,527
You can ring them by tapping

1718
00:58:51,527 --> 00:58:53,796
audio or video, but we also

1719
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:55,130
introduced a great new way

1720
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:56,432
because Facetime is now

1721
00:58:56,432 --> 00:58:59,034
integrated into messages, so you

1722
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,236
can quickly go from a group chat

1723
00:59:01,236 --> 00:59:03,539
you have going directly into a

1724
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:05,674
group Facetime, and members of

1725
00:59:05,674 --> 00:59:07,443
the group can join in and drop

1726
00:59:07,443 --> 00:59:09,178
out at any time.

1727
00:59:09,178 --> 00:59:10,479
It's really great.

1728
00:59:10,479 --> 00:59:11,380
Would you like to see it?

1729
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,615
[applause] Well let's do a demo.

1730
00:59:12,615 --> 00:59:16,752
[applause] Well I think for our

1731
00:59:16,752 --> 00:59:19,588
first live demo of group

1732
00:59:19,588 --> 00:59:22,124
Facetime, I'm going to contact

1733
00:59:22,124 --> 00:59:23,792
the folks back in Cupertino.

1734
00:59:23,792 --> 00:59:25,260
I can just dive in to this

1735
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,262
conversation I have going with

1736
00:59:27,262 --> 00:59:28,497
the members of the Facetime

1737
00:59:28,497 --> 00:59:30,366
team, and it looks like actually

1738
00:59:30,366 --> 00:59:31,200
they're already on a group

1739
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,936
Facetime call, so I'm just going

1740
00:59:33,936 --> 00:59:39,942
to join right in.

1741
00:59:39,942 --> 00:59:41,510
Hey everybody.

1742
00:59:41,510 --> 00:59:43,512
Hey Craig.

1743
00:59:43,512 --> 00:59:44,613
Check it out.

1744
00:59:44,613 --> 00:59:46,649
So it's this beautiful Facetime

1745
00:59:46,649 --> 00:59:49,585
UI with these big gorgeous tiles

1746
00:59:49,585 --> 00:59:51,153
right up front where you see

1747
00:59:51,153 --> 00:59:52,421
some of the leaders of the

1748
00:59:52,421 --> 00:59:53,789
Facetime team, and down at the

1749
00:59:53,789 --> 00:59:55,557
bottom there's and area we call

1750
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,192
the roster that contains

1751
00:59:57,192 --> 00:59:58,027
everybody else.

1752
00:59:58,027 --> 00:59:59,194
And of course I'm right there in

1753
00:59:59,194 --> 01:00:01,130
the lower right-hand corner.

1754
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:02,197
Hey Craig.

1755
01:00:02,197 --> 01:00:04,233
Wait, am I on the big screen?

1756
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,701
Yes, Lauren, this is not a

1757
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:06,635
test.

1758
01:00:06,635 --> 01:00:08,404
You're in front of 6000 of your

1759
01:00:08,404 --> 01:00:09,505
biggest new fans.

[ Applause ]

1761
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,613
Now, what you probably notice is

1762
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:19,148
when Lauren spoke, her tile

1763
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,983
automatically got larger to

1764
01:00:20,983 --> 01:00:22,718
reflect her prominence in the

1765
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:23,485
conversation.

1766
01:00:23,485 --> 01:00:25,487
This is totally automatic.

1767
01:00:25,487 --> 01:00:26,789
Hey Roberto, how's it going back

1768
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,357
there in Cupertino?

1769
01:00:28,357 --> 01:00:30,459
I'd say it's going pretty

1770
01:00:30,459 --> 01:00:32,194
well, and Lauren, sorry for

1771
01:00:32,194 --> 01:00:34,163
stealing your spotlight.

1772
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,297
So this works of course for

1773
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:37,166
people in the roster as well.

1774
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,100
When they speak, they come

1775
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:38,934
forward.

01:00:38,934 --> 01:00:39,768
Hey Christopher, you ready to

1777
01:00:39,768 --> 01:00:40,602
make your big entrance?

01:00:40,602 --> 01:00:43,172
Finally, my moment has come.

1779
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,006
Hello world.

1783
01:00:52,781 --> 01:00:55,050

1789
01:01:03,025 --> 01:01:04,093
to share Group Facetime with

this, but we've also brought the

development of the watch many

1858

just how impactful and essential

1860
01:03:20,195 --> 01:03:22,764
it could become in our lives, so

1861
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,967
we worked very hard to create

of them with you this morning.

1880
01:04:04,006 --> 01:04:06,708
Mary Dovgen was boating with her

1881
01:04:06,708 --> 01:04:08,911
husband, John, when due to a

1882
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:11,380
medical condition all of John's

1883
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,448
muscles went completely limp,

1884
01:04:13,448 --> 01:04:15,517
and he fell into the ice cold

1885
01:04:15,517 --> 01:04:17,019
water.

1886
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:18,520
With her arms wrapped around

1887
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:21,223
John to keep him from drowning,

1888
01:04:21,223 --> 01:04:23,992
Mary could not reach her phone

1889
01:04:23,992 --> 01:04:26,428
to call for help.

1890
01:04:26,428 --> 01:04:28,664
But with her Apple Watch, she

1891
01:04:28,664 --> 01:04:31,400
was able to call Siri, or to use

1892
01:04:31,400 --> 01:04:34,636
Siri to call 911, rescuers soon

1893
01:04:34,636 --> 01:04:38,507
arrived, and saved John's live.

1894
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:42,644
[ Applause ]

1895
01:04:42,644 --> 01:04:45,414
As Mary told us, if it wasn't

1896
01:04:45,414 --> 01:04:47,983
for my Apple Watch, he really

1897
01:04:47,983 --> 01:04:50,719
would not be here today.

1898
01:04:50,719 --> 01:04:52,187
This is just one of the many

1899
01:04:52,187 --> 01:04:53,722
stories that we've heard about

1900
01:04:53,722 --> 01:04:55,457
about how Apple Watch is

1901
01:04:55,457 --> 01:04:57,559
impacting people's lives.

1902
01:04:57,559 --> 01:04:59,428
They range from getting people

1903
01:04:59,428 --> 01:05:00,963
to be more active, to helping

1904
01:05:00,963 --> 01:05:04,499
users live a healthier life, or

1905
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:06,234
even to alerting users to an

1906
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:08,003
elevated heart rate.

1907
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:10,439
Apple Watch brings such amazing

1908
01:05:10,439 --> 01:05:13,442
capabilities right to the wrist,

1909
01:05:13,442 --> 01:05:14,710
and of course at the heart of

1910
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,546
this is watchOS.

1911
01:05:17,546 --> 01:05:19,181
We're excited to introduce

1912
01:05:19,181 --> 01:05:22,017
watchOS 5 today, which brings

1913
01:05:22,017 --> 01:05:23,952
even more ways for you to stay

1914
01:05:23,952 --> 01:05:26,888
active and connected, and I'd

1915
01:05:26,888 --> 01:05:28,657
like to hand it off to Kevin

1916
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,492
Lynch to tell you all about it.

1917
01:05:30,492 --> 01:05:31,493
Kevin.

1918
01:05:31,493 --> 01:05:37,032
[ Applause ]

1919
01:05:37,032 --> 01:05:38,266
Good morning.

1920
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:39,267
You know, stories like that,

1921
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:40,469
about how Apple Watch is

1922
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:41,570
supporting people around the

1923
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:44,106
world in even extreme situations

1924
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,440
like Mary and John's but also in

1925
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:46,942
their daily lives is really

1926
01:05:46,942 --> 01:05:48,176
super motivating to us as a

1927
01:05:48,176 --> 01:05:48,977
team.

1928
01:05:48,977 --> 01:05:50,512
And there are things you do

1929
01:05:50,512 --> 01:05:51,980
every day that shape your life.

1930
01:05:51,980 --> 01:05:54,416
And Apple Watch has two

1931
01:05:54,416 --> 01:05:55,550
[inaudible] working to help you

1932
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,052
support those activities every

1933
01:05:57,052 --> 01:05:58,653
day.

1934
01:05:58,653 --> 01:05:59,821
First, staying active to

1935
01:05:59,821 --> 01:06:00,922
increase your well-being and

1936
01:06:00,922 --> 01:06:02,290
health and second being

1937
01:06:02,290 --> 01:06:03,358
connected to the people and the

1938
01:06:03,358 --> 01:06:04,493
information that you care most

1939
01:06:04,493 --> 01:06:06,194
about, and we're moving watchOS

1940
01:06:06,194 --> 01:06:08,363
in both of these areas.

1941
01:06:08,363 --> 01:06:09,464
Let's start with health and

1942
01:06:09,464 --> 01:06:10,599
fitness.

1943
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:11,533
Now much of the power in the

1944
01:06:11,533 --> 01:06:12,667
health and fitness features that

1945
01:06:12,667 --> 01:06:14,603
we've put in Watch are really

1946
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:15,904
empowered by the investment we

1947
01:06:15,904 --> 01:06:18,006
do to make sure the data you see

1948
01:06:18,006 --> 01:06:19,207
is accurate.

1949
01:06:19,207 --> 01:06:20,342
The data from our custom-built

1950
01:06:20,342 --> 01:06:21,176
heart rate sensor,

1951
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:23,412
Accelerometer, Gyro, GPS, are

1952
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:25,080
all thoroughly validated.

1953
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,715
In fact, from our fitness lab,

1954
01:06:26,715 --> 01:06:28,383
we've studied over six terabytes

1955
01:06:28,383 --> 01:06:30,452
of data where 12,000 study

1956
01:06:30,452 --> 01:06:32,421
participants logged over 90,000

1957
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:33,455
hours of sessions.

1958
01:06:33,455 --> 01:06:35,023
And they actually burned 2.3

1959
01:06:35,023 --> 01:06:37,192
million calories doing this.

1960
01:06:37,192 --> 01:06:38,427
We believe this is the largest

1961
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:39,861
biometric data collection of its

1962
01:06:39,861 --> 01:06:40,695
kind.

1963
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:42,898
And we take this information and

1964
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,032
we work to integrate this

1965
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:45,033
seamlessly with the user

1966
01:06:45,033 --> 01:06:46,535
experience so when you raise

1967
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:47,602
your wrist and you look at your

1968
01:06:47,602 --> 01:06:49,104
activity rings, the information

1969
01:06:49,104 --> 01:06:50,138
is not only accurate, but it's

1970
01:06:50,138 --> 01:06:51,773
also meaningful to you.

1971
01:06:51,773 --> 01:06:52,841
We really love hearing about

1972
01:06:52,841 --> 01:06:54,242
your focus on closing these

1973
01:06:54,242 --> 01:06:55,510
rings.

1974
01:06:55,510 --> 01:06:56,578
And we really enable this

1975
01:06:56,578 --> 01:06:57,512
through a number of ways in

1976
01:06:57,512 --> 01:06:58,847
Apple Watch.

1977
01:06:58,847 --> 01:07:00,582
First, of course, we do daily

1978
01:07:00,582 --> 01:07:01,650
coaching so you can see what

1979
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,385
your goals are for the day.

1980
01:07:03,385 --> 01:07:04,753
We also support celebrations

1981
01:07:04,753 --> 01:07:06,922
when you achieve your goals, and

1982
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:07,823
we have special edition

1983
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:09,424
challenges like the most recent

1984
01:07:09,424 --> 01:07:11,526
birthday challenge that we did.

1985
01:07:11,526 --> 01:07:13,195
And on a monthly basis, we do

1986
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,129
monthly goals that are

1987
01:07:14,129 --> 01:07:15,197
personalized to you.

1988
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,566
And of course the activity app

1989
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,301
also supports activity sharing,

1990
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:20,302
which has become one of the most

1991
01:07:20,302 --> 01:07:21,937
popular features of the activity

1992
01:07:21,937 --> 01:07:22,771
app.

1993
01:07:22,771 --> 01:07:25,006
Many of you love the excitement

1994
01:07:25,006 --> 01:07:26,041
of good old-fashioned

1995
01:07:26,041 --> 01:07:27,476
competition though, so in

1996
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:29,377
watchOS 5, you can challenge any

1997
01:07:29,377 --> 01:07:30,912
of your activity-sharing friends

1998
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:32,280
to a seven-day competition

1999
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,115
whenever you would like.

2000
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:35,450
And if they accept, you each try

2001
01:07:35,450 --> 01:07:36,985
to win the week by closing your

2002
01:07:36,985 --> 01:07:38,286
rings and earning points.

2003
01:07:38,286 --> 01:07:39,287
You earn one point for each

2004
01:07:39,287 --> 01:07:40,088
percent of a ring that you

2005
01:07:40,088 --> 01:07:40,922
close.

2006
01:07:40,922 --> 01:07:42,057
And while you're in the middle

2007
01:07:42,057 --> 01:07:43,625
of a competition, your progress

2008
01:07:43,625 --> 01:07:45,127
notifications are updated, do

2009
01:07:45,127 --> 01:07:46,428
not only show you the progress

2010
01:07:46,428 --> 01:07:47,562
your friends are making, but

2011
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:48,763
also where you stand in the

2012
01:07:48,763 --> 01:07:50,031
competition.

2013
01:07:50,031 --> 01:07:52,868
And when you win, you receive a

2014
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:53,902
new award.

2015
01:07:53,902 --> 01:07:55,003
We're really excited about this

2016
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:55,804
edition, and if you're

2017
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:56,605
competition, it gives you a

2018
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:57,939
whole new way to enjoy the

2019
01:07:57,939 --> 01:07:59,841
activity app.

2020
01:07:59,841 --> 01:08:01,476
Now when you're doing

2021
01:08:06,081 --> 01:08:06,915
[applause]-- now when you do

2022
01:08:06,915 --> 01:08:07,749
want to go do a workout, there's

2023
01:08:07,749 --> 01:08:08,817
a lot of workout types you can

2024
01:08:08,817 --> 01:08:10,585
choose from, and they all have

2025
01:08:10,585 --> 01:08:11,820
custom algorithms to measure

2026
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,388
things like calorie burn, pace,

2027
01:08:13,388 --> 01:08:15,157
distance, elevation gain, and

2028
01:08:15,157 --> 01:08:16,024
when you're swimming, it even

2029
01:08:16,024 --> 01:08:17,359
counts laps and detects which

2030
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,693
swim strokes you're using.

2031
01:08:18,693 --> 01:08:20,328
And with Gym Kit, your metrics

2032
01:08:20,328 --> 01:08:21,696
are in sync with your favorite

2033
01:08:21,696 --> 01:08:22,564
gym equipment.

2034
01:08:22,564 --> 01:08:23,497
And we're really excited to

2035
01:08:23,497 --> 01:08:24,431
bring more enhancements to

2036
01:08:24,432 --> 01:08:27,002
workouts in watchOS 5, starting

2037
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:28,236
with a new workout type for

2038
01:08:28,236 --> 01:08:29,069
yoga.

2039
01:08:29,069 --> 01:08:30,304
Now this works primarily from

2040
01:08:30,305 --> 01:08:32,674
your heart rate, and we

2041
01:08:32,674 --> 01:08:34,209
calibrate this to your fitness

2042
01:08:34,209 --> 01:08:35,544
through the rest of your day, so

2043
01:08:35,544 --> 01:08:36,478
now you can more accurately

2044
01:08:36,478 --> 01:08:38,046
track those yoga sessions

2045
01:08:38,046 --> 01:08:39,613
including those intense Vinyasa

2046
01:08:39,613 --> 01:08:40,614
sessions.

2047
01:08:40,615 --> 01:08:42,651
New we've also added a new

2048
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,519
workout type for hiking.

2049
01:08:44,519 --> 01:08:45,953
This takes into account pace and

2050
01:08:45,953 --> 01:08:47,755
heart rate and elevation gain so

2051
01:08:47,756 --> 01:08:48,790
you can more accurately get

2052
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:50,024
exercise credit while you're

2053
01:08:50,024 --> 01:08:51,725
hiking on steep terrain or

2054
01:08:51,725 --> 01:08:53,327
really long stages.

2055
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:56,698
And Apple watch has become a

2056
01:08:56,698 --> 01:08:58,533
really great running companion

2057
01:08:58,533 --> 01:08:59,801
especially now that we've added

2058
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:01,670
GPS and cellular and music

2059
01:09:01,670 --> 01:09:02,504
streaming.

2060
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:03,404
And we're making this an even

2061
01:09:03,404 --> 01:09:04,805
better experience now for

2062
01:09:04,805 --> 01:09:06,640
training runs and races.

2063
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:07,575
In addition to current and

2064
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:08,977
average pace, you now have the

01:14:01,503 --> 01:14:04,239
Siri watch phase.

2253
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,407
Now currently to talk to Siri

2254
01:14:06,407 --> 01:14:07,208
you raise your wrist and you

2255
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:08,376
say, hey Siri.

2256
01:14:08,376 --> 01:14:09,711
And when you think about this,

2257
01:14:09,711 --> 01:14:10,845
it's quite a strong signal when

2258
01:14:10,845 --> 01:14:12,113
you raise your wrist and talk to

2259
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:12,947
your watch.

2260
01:14:12,947 --> 01:14:13,781
It's kind of like when someone's

2261
01:14:13,781 --> 01:14:14,916
standing right in front of you,

2262
01:14:14,916 --> 01:14:15,750
you don't need to say hey

2263
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:16,651
because you have their attention

2264
01:14:16,651 --> 01:14:18,453
already, so we're bringing this

2265
01:14:18,453 --> 01:14:20,622
same social cue to Siri on the

2266
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:23,124
watch so you no longer need to

2267
01:14:23,124 --> 01:14:24,859
say, hey Siri.

2268
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:26,027
You just raise your wrist and

2269
01:14:26,027 --> 01:14:27,629
talk to Siri.

2270
01:14:32,300 --> 01:14:32,967
[applause] Now we're also

2271
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:33,801
bringing a number of

2272
01:14:33,801 --> 01:14:35,303
improvements to Notifications,

2273
01:14:35,303 --> 01:14:36,538
which are now more actionable

2274
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,872
and interactive.

2275
01:14:37,872 --> 01:14:38,907
So, for example, with this

2276
01:14:38,907 --> 01:14:40,508
notification from Quantis, you

2277
01:14:40,508 --> 01:14:41,543
can check in and share your

2278
01:14:41,543 --> 01:14:42,844
flight details right from the

2279
01:14:42,844 --> 01:14:44,512
notification.

2280
01:14:44,512 --> 01:14:45,547
After you finish a ride with

2281
01:14:45,547 --> 01:14:47,248
Dee, you can scroll down.

2282
01:14:47,248 --> 01:14:48,650
You can rate your ride and pay

2283
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,251
with Apple Pay right there in

2284
01:14:50,251 --> 01:14:51,853
the notification.

2285
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:53,087
And with this one from Yelp that

2286
01:14:53,087 --> 01:14:54,355
your table is ready, if you need

2287
01:14:54,355 --> 01:14:55,623
a bit more time, you can extend

2288
01:14:55,623 --> 01:14:56,925
the reservation out a bit just

2289
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:58,126
by tapping here.

2290
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,561
So super easy now to interact

2291
01:14:59,561 --> 01:15:00,461
right in place inside

2293
01:15:02,664 --> 01:15:03,965
We've also improved our Message

2294
01:15:03,965 --> 01:15:05,166
notification.

2295
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:06,167
Today if someone sends you a

2296
01:15:06,167 --> 01:15:07,802
weblink, you aren't able to view

2297
01:15:07,802 --> 01:15:08,937
it on your list.

2298
01:15:08,937 --> 01:15:11,072
With watchOS 5, we've integrated

2299
01:15:11,072 --> 01:15:12,206
WebKit, so now you have the

2300
01:15:12,206 --> 01:15:14,075
ability to view web content and

2301
01:15:14,075 --> 01:15:16,344
mail or messages.

2302
01:15:16,344 --> 01:15:18,212
You can even tap on that link,

2303
01:15:18,212 --> 01:15:20,548
yes, to easily view things like

2304
01:15:20,548 --> 01:15:21,382
menus here.

2305
01:15:21,382 --> 01:15:23,518
And while we think full browsing

2306
01:15:23,518 --> 01:15:24,385
doesn't make sense on your

2307
01:15:24,385 --> 01:15:25,753
wrist, there are times you get

2308
01:15:25,753 --> 01:15:26,588
content.

2309
01:15:26,588 --> 01:15:27,422
You'd like to see it right in

2310
01:15:27,422 --> 01:15:28,256
the moment, and now you'll be

2311
01:15:28,256 --> 01:15:29,857
able to do that and watch OS 5.

2312
01:15:29,857 --> 01:15:30,725
And the contents can be

2313
01:15:30,725 --> 01:15:32,126
formatted for the small screen,

2314
01:15:32,126 --> 01:15:33,227
and the where reader made is

2315
01:15:33,227 --> 01:15:34,295
available, it uses that on the

2316
01:15:34,295 --> 01:15:35,063
watch.

2317
01:15:35,063 --> 01:15:37,498
So WebKit on watchOS.

2319

Now with watchOS 4, we

2320
01:15:45,073 --> 01:15:46,541
introduced an entirely new way

2321
01:15:46,541 --> 01:15:47,642
to listen to music while you're

2322
01:15:47,642 --> 01:15:48,476

01:15:48,476 --> 01:15:50,078
You can stream 48 million songs

2325
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,647

And now with watchOS 5, we're

2328
01:15:56,985 --> 01:15:57,919
giving you even more to listen

2329
01:15:57,919 --> 01:15:58,519
to.

That's right.

The Apple podcast app is coming

01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,261
to Apple Watch.

2334
01:16:07,261 --> 01:16:08,463
Upcoming episodes from

01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:09,731
subscribed podcasts will be

2336
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:10,865
automatically synced to your

2337

watch, so you can get them right

2338
01:16:12,233 --> 01:16:14,602
there, or you can just ask Siri

2339
01:16:14,602 --> 01:16:15,937
to stream a podcast for you, and

2340
01:16:15,937 --> 01:16:17,705
it'll start playing and playback

2341
01:16:17,705 --> 01:16:19,307
resume across all your devices

2342
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:20,575
so you can continue just where

2343
01:16:20,575 --> 01:16:21,676
you left off.

2344
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,978
So that's Podcast.

2345
01:16:23,978 --> 01:16:24,846
Now those are the great new

2346
01:16:24,846 --> 01:16:26,347

stuff live in action, and we

2356
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:40,595
thought we'd increase the

2362
01:16:47,935 --> 01:16:48,770

01:16:57,478 --> 01:16:58,546
coaching, and she knows how to

move and demonstrate and

01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:00,448
motivate all at the same time.

really going to love, and the

closing my rings while I do it.

2376
01:17:09,891 --> 01:17:11,993
So, first, I'm super excited to

01:17:11,993 --> 01:17:13,628
show you how easy it is to start

2378
01:17:13,628 --> 01:17:14,896
a workout with GymKit.

I just tap to connect and accept

01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:20,234
on the watch, and now I can

2381
01:17:20,234 --> 01:17:22,603
control and start the workout

2382
01:17:22,603 --> 01:17:23,871
right here from the console on

All of my data between the watch

2385
01:17:26,874 --> 01:17:28,376
and the bike is in sync, and all

2386
01:17:28,376 --> 01:17:29,477
of my workout metrics are

2387
01:17:29,477 --> 01:17:30,878
accurate.

2388
01:17:30,878 --> 01:17:32,013
Now, I wouldn't typically be

that Jay has moved ahead of me

2407
01:17:58,873 --> 01:18:00,007
by a couple of points, and

2408
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:01,042
that's not okay because this

him a little smack talk to let

2418
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:16,324
him know I'm coming for him.

Now in watchOS 5, notifications

We're trying to get to a yoga

retreat this summer, and it

2444
01:18:57,265 --> 01:18:59,033
looks like she sent me a link.

2445
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:01,936
Now, I can tap it here and see

01:19:01,936 --> 01:19:03,671
if she's found somewhere great

Next up is Glow Baby, because

2466
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:36,704
it's about this time each day

2467

that I check the app to see if

01:19:38,139 --> 01:19:39,140
my husband has logged our

Oh, good job, baby.

parents know that good naps

2473
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,447
equal good nights, so I'm

2474
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,282
looking forward to that.

Here's that dinner that Siri

2481
01:19:58,526 --> 01:20:00,294
found in my calendar, and

2482
01:20:00,294 --> 01:20:01,829
waiting for me at the end of my

Now, I want to check back in on

2487
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:10,838
this competition, but I thought

2488
01:20:10,838 --> 01:20:12,106
it might be a good idea to get a

2489
01:20:12,106 --> 01:20:13,474
little moral support from my

And you heard Kevin say how

2492
01:20:16,110 --> 01:20:17,778
walkie talkie is so great for

staying in touch with close

friends and family.

2495
01:20:19,747 --> 01:20:21,482
So I set my daughter up with

2496
01:20:21,482 --> 01:20:23,284
walkie talkie so that she can

2497
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:24,452
help demo what it's like to

2498
01:20:24,452 --> 01:20:26,187
receive one and maybe give me a

And apps can include interactive

01:24:13,514 --> 01:24:14,949
Since its introduction, the

2624
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:16,951
Apple TV business has grown an

2625
01:24:16,951 --> 01:24:19,920
incredible 50 percent.

2626
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:21,622
Today, we've got some great new

2627
01:24:21,622 --> 01:24:24,024
enhancements to Apple TV 4K and

2628
01:24:24,024 --> 01:24:25,593
tvOS, and we think you're going

2629
01:24:25,593 --> 01:24:26,694
to love them.

2630
01:24:26,694 --> 01:24:29,697
So I'd like to invite Apple TV

2631
01:24:29,697 --> 01:24:31,699
lead designer, Jen Fuls

2632
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:32,700
[phonetic] to the stage to tell

2633
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:33,601
you all about it.

2634
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:34,435
Jen. [applause]

2635
01:24:34,435 --> 01:24:36,504
Thanks Tim.

2636
01:24:36,504 --> 01:24:40,174
[ Applause ]

2637
01:24:40,174 --> 01:24:41,408
Apple TV is built on an

2638
01:24:41,408 --> 01:24:43,878
incredible platform, tvOS.

2639
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:46,780
And tvOS is built specifically

2640
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,182
for the living room, to make it

2641
01:24:48,182 --> 01:24:50,184
easy to enjoy your favorite TV

2642
01:24:50,184 --> 01:24:53,554
shows, movies, apps, and games.

2643
01:24:53,554 --> 01:24:54,922
Now as Tim mentioned, last

2644
01:24:54,922 --> 01:24:56,891
September, we introduced Apple

2645
01:24:56,891 --> 01:24:59,527
TV 4K with the goal of bringing

2646
01:24:59,527 --> 01:25:01,228
the highest quality cinematic

2647
01:25:01,228 --> 01:25:04,298
experience right to your home.

2648
01:25:04,298 --> 01:25:06,967
It offers both 4K and high

2649
01:25:06,967 --> 01:25:08,969
dynamic range, including support

2650
01:25:08,969 --> 01:25:11,972
for HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.

2651
01:25:11,972 --> 01:25:14,041
Time said, the new Apple TV is a

2652
01:25:14,041 --> 01:25:16,577
high fidelity powerhouse.

2653
01:25:16,577 --> 01:25:18,445
And to ensure you can enjoy this

2654
01:25:18,445 --> 01:25:20,014
beautiful experience with as

2655
01:25:20,014 --> 01:25:23,584
much content as possible, iTunes

2656
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:26,120
offers the largest collection of

2657
01:25:26,120 --> 01:25:28,489
4K HDR movies.

2658

[ Applause ]

2659
01:25:32,426 --> 01:25:33,761
And we've upgraded your

2660
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:35,229
previously purchased movies to

2661
01:25:35,229 --> 01:25:37,865
4K HDR for free on all available

2662
01:25:37,865 --> 01:25:39,567
titles.

2663
01:25:39,567 --> 01:25:42,169
There are also, thank you, there

2664
01:25:42,169 --> 01:25:44,838
are also many 4K and HDR TV

2665
01:25:44,838 --> 01:25:46,407
shows available from popular

2666
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,475
services like Amazon Prime video

2667
01:25:48,475 --> 01:25:50,678
and Netflix.

2668
01:25:50,678 --> 01:25:52,179
And we know what makes for an

2669
01:25:52,179 --> 01:25:54,348
amazing cinematic experience is

2670
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:56,750
not just great picture quality.

2671
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,752
It's also incredible sound.

2672
01:25:58,752 --> 01:26:02,423
So Apple TV 4K is bringing you

2673
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:04,959
the latest in audio technology,

2674
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:08,996
Dolby Atmos.

2675
01:26:10,464 --> 01:26:15,569
[ Applause ]

2676
01:26:15,569 --> 01:26:18,272
With Atmos, you get room-filling

2677
01:26:18,272 --> 01:26:19,106
sound.

2678
01:26:19,106 --> 01:26:20,641
The perfect complement to the

2679
01:26:20,641 --> 01:26:23,711
stunning visuals of Apple TV 4K.

2680
01:26:23,711 --> 01:26:26,347
Now what makes Atmos so special

2681
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:27,815
is that unlike a traditional

2682
01:26:27,815 --> 01:26:28,916
surround sound setup, where

2683
01:26:28,916 --> 01:26:30,317
sound is assigned to channels

2684
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:32,853
like the left or the right,

2685
01:26:32,853 --> 01:26:34,655
Dolby Atmos has the ability to

2686
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:37,224
completely immerse you.

2687
01:26:37,224 --> 01:26:38,759
Atmos moves sound in

2688
01:26:38,759 --> 01:26:40,361
three-dimensional space,

2689
01:26:40,361 --> 01:26:41,829
creating an experience with

2690
01:26:41,829 --> 01:26:43,998
powerful audio that flows all

2691
01:26:43,998 --> 01:26:44,999
around you.

2692
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,667
It puts you right in the center

2693
01:26:46,667 --> 01:26:48,402
of the action.

2694
01:26:48,402 --> 01:26:50,104
All this with a home theater

2695
01:26:50,104 --> 01:26:52,373
setup as simple as a Dolby Atmos

2696
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,608
enabled soundbar and an Apple TV

2697
01:26:54,608 --> 01:26:55,776
4K.

2698
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:58,545
In fact, Apple TV 4K is the only

2699
01:26:58,545 --> 01:26:59,813
streaming player to be both

2700
01:26:59,813 --> 01:27:01,515
Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos

2701
01:27:01,515 --> 01:27:02,449

And just like with 4K HDR, your

2708
01:27:17,331 --> 01:27:18,666
iTunes libraries will be

2709
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:20,734
upgraded to include Dolby Atmos

on all supported titles for

2711
01:27:23,437 --> 01:27:27,608
free.

01:27:27,608 --> 01:27:28,442
[applause] Now of course these

2713
01:27:28,442 --> 01:27:30,210
movies and so much more are

2714
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:33,247
available in the Apple TV app.

2715
01:27:33,247 --> 01:27:35,349
The Apple TV app is the center

2716
01:27:35,349 --> 01:27:37,351
of your video experience, a

2717
01:27:37,351 --> 01:27:39,219
single place to find and watch

2718
01:27:39,219 --> 01:27:40,487
what you love across your

2719
01:27:40,487 --> 01:27:41,889
favorite apps.

2720
01:27:41,889 --> 01:27:44,291
It's on Apple TV, iPad and

2721
01:27:44,291 --> 01:27:45,926
iPhone where you can find not

2722
01:27:45,926 --> 01:27:47,494
only On Demand TV shows and

2723
01:27:47,494 --> 01:27:49,930
movies but also live content

2724
01:27:49,930 --> 01:27:51,498
including sports.

2725
01:27:51,498 --> 01:27:53,167
The Apple TV app now offers a

2726
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:57,137
huge range of live sports.

2727
01:27:57,137 --> 01:27:59,139
And we've added live news to

2728
01:27:59,139 --> 01:28:00,808
make it even easier to stay

2729
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,343
current.

2730
01:28:02,343 --> 01:28:04,311
The edition of live sports and

2731
01:28:04,311 --> 01:28:05,379
news providers brings the

2732
01:28:05,379 --> 01:28:07,047
coverage of the TV app to over

2733
01:28:07,047 --> 01:28:10,617
100 video channels, giving you a

2734
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:12,653
massive selection of content all

2735
01:28:12,653 --> 01:28:14,288
in one place.

2736
01:28:14,288 --> 01:28:16,190
With all this, Apple TV is the

2737
01:28:16,190 --> 01:28:18,559
best box to connect to your TV.

2738
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:20,294
And that's now more true than

2739
01:28:20,294 --> 01:28:22,129
ever as more and more cable

2740
01:28:22,129 --> 01:28:24,565
companies fundamentally shift

2741
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:26,400
how video gets to your TV.

2742
01:28:26,400 --> 01:28:27,935
This typical cable box is

2743
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:31,038
becoming a thing of the past as

2744
01:28:31,038 --> 01:28:32,239
these companies embrace

2745
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,208
internet-based delivery.

2746
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,410
And many of them share our

2747
01:28:36,410 --> 01:28:38,645
vision of Apple TV as the one

2748
01:28:38,645 --> 01:28:41,115
device for live, On Demand, and

2749
01:28:41,115 --> 01:28:43,617
Cloud DVR content.

2750
01:28:43,617 --> 01:28:44,551
And we've already started

2751
01:28:44,551 --> 01:28:46,053
working with partners around the

2752
01:28:46,053 --> 01:28:48,922
world to make this a reality.

2753
01:28:48,922 --> 01:28:50,424
In France, we're working with

2754
01:28:50,424 --> 01:28:52,226
Canal Plus.

2755
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:53,627
Almost a third of French

2756
01:28:53,627 --> 01:28:55,095
households subscribe to Canal

2757
01:28:55,095 --> 01:28:57,131

in 4K.

2763
01:29:06,173 --> 01:29:09,143
In Switzerland, we've partnered

2764
01:29:09,143 --> 01:29:10,377
with Salt.

2765
01:29:10,377 --> 01:29:11,879
Salt just launched a new TV

2766

2768
01:29:16,150 --> 01:29:18,786
exclusively on Apple TV.

2769
01:29:18,786 --> 01:29:21,555
And I'm really excited to

01:29:21,555 --> 01:29:22,823
announce that here in the U.S.,

2771
01:29:22,823 --> 01:29:24,458

[ Applause ]

2774
01:29:32,199 --> 01:29:34,468
That means that up to 50 million

2775
01:29:34,468 --> 01:29:35,836
homes will be able to choose

2776
01:29:35,836 --> 01:29:37,971
Apple TV to access all their

01:29:37,971 --> 01:29:39,940
live channels and thousands of

01:29:39,940 --> 01:29:41,508
On Demand programs.

2779
01:29:41,508 --> 01:29:43,277
And, they'll be able to use Siri

2780
01:29:43,277 --> 01:29:45,512
and the TV app to get access to

2781
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:47,281
their TV service not only on

as well.

2784
01:29:52,820 --> 01:29:53,654
Now with nearly any cable

2785
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:55,389
subscription, you can get access

2786
01:29:55,389 --> 01:29:57,891
to dozens of video channels like

2787
01:29:57,891 --> 01:30:00,594
ESPN, Showtime, NBC, and many

2788
01:30:00,594 --> 01:30:02,830
more, but it used to be really

2789
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,865
painful to set up, having to

2790
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:06,366
authenticate each app

2791
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:07,367
individually.

I'm sure all of you have seen

01:30:08,502 --> 01:30:09,903
that six-digit code you have to

Well now we're making it even

Charter Spectrum [applause]--

2813
01:30:47,641 --> 01:30:51,612
this is really awesome-- and

2814
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:52,946
Charter Spectrum will be the

2815
01:30:52,946 --> 01:30:54,548
first to support zero sign-on

2816
01:30:54,548 --> 01:30:55,482
and we'll be adding more

2817
01:30:55,482 --> 01:30:57,718
providers over time.

2818
01:30:57,718 --> 01:30:59,119
We're also giving you even more

2819
01:30:59,119 --> 01:31:00,654
options for ways to control your

2820
01:31:00,654 --> 01:31:02,189
Apple TV.

2821
01:31:02,189 --> 01:31:03,824
For example, you can get quick

2822
01:31:03,824 --> 01:31:05,526
access on your iPhone where

2823
01:31:05,526 --> 01:31:07,027
Apple TV users will get the

2824
01:31:07,027 --> 01:31:09,096
Apple TV remote automatically

2825
01:31:09,096 --> 01:31:10,797
added to control center.

2826
01:31:10,797 --> 01:31:12,866
And, for those that have

2827
01:31:12,866 --> 01:31:14,635
installed home control systems,

2828
01:31:14,635 --> 01:31:15,802
we're working with the leading

2829
01:31:15,802 --> 01:31:17,271
providers so that you can use

2830
01:31:17,271 --> 01:31:18,805
their remotes to control your

2831
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:21,041
Apple TV, even including support

2832
01:31:21,041 --> 01:31:22,276
for Siri.

2833
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:26,413
At Apple, I love working with an

2834
01:31:26,413 --> 01:31:28,448
amazing team designing for a

2835
01:31:28,448 --> 01:31:30,350
product that I enjoy every day

2836
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:32,286
and on the biggest screen in my

2837
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:33,220
home.

2838
01:31:33,220 --> 01:31:36,590
I get to watch all my favorite

2839
01:31:36,590 --> 01:31:39,826
movies, TV shows and more.

2840
01:31:39,826 --> 01:31:42,362
Over 40 million songs including

2841
01:31:42,362 --> 01:31:45,866
the best metal on Apple Music.

2842
01:31:45,866 --> 01:31:47,968
All of my photos, videos, and

2843
01:31:47,968 --> 01:31:50,871
memories as well as thousands of

2844
01:31:50,871 --> 01:31:52,973
apps and games that many of you

2845
01:31:52,973 --> 01:31:54,274
have built.

2846
01:31:54,274 --> 01:31:57,311
And, Apple TV brings some

2847
01:31:57,311 --> 01:31:59,880
amazing views right to my living

2848
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:02,316
room with Aerials.

2849
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:03,650
Now, one of the questions I get

2850
01:32:03,650 --> 01:32:05,319
asked the most about Aerials,

2851
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:06,787
especially by my family members

2852
01:32:06,787 --> 01:32:08,755
is where is this?

2853
01:32:08,755 --> 01:32:11,091
Well, this ball with just a tap

2854
01:32:11,091 --> 01:32:13,093
of the Siri remote, you'll now

2855
01:32:13,093 --> 01:32:15,195
be able to see every Arial

2856
01:32:15,195 --> 01:32:16,496

2858
01:32:21,602 --> 01:32:23,170
And, you can even swipe between

2859
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,472
locations so you can see even

2860
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,306
more.

2861
01:32:26,306 --> 01:32:29,476
And today, I have an incredible

2862
01:32:29,476 --> 01:32:31,144
new location to share with you.

2863
01:32:31,144 --> 01:32:34,414
For the past year, we've been

2864
01:32:34,414 --> 01:32:36,083
collaborating closely with an

2865
01:32:36,083 --> 01:32:38,185
amazing partner, filming some

2866
01:32:38,185 --> 01:32:39,686
stunning footage from around the

2867
01:32:39,686 --> 01:32:42,322
world with a very unique vantage

2868
01:32:42,322 --> 01:32:46,927
point, and here it is.

Earth.

[ Applause ]

2871
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:57,437
This is filmed by astronauts

2872
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:59,172
aboard the International Space

2873
01:32:59,172 --> 01:33:00,107
Station.

2874
01:33:00,107 --> 01:33:01,675
You can see Sicily just off the

2875
01:33:01,675 --> 01:33:03,343
boot of Italy, and check out

2876
01:33:03,343 --> 01:33:04,578
that Mediterranean Sea.

2877
01:33:04,578 --> 01:33:06,480
The blue is just phenomenal.

2878
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,316
So here's a fun fact.

2879
01:33:09,316 --> 01:33:10,917
The Space Station makes an orbit

2880
01:33:10,917 --> 01:33:13,053
every 90 minutes, so that means

2881
01:33:13,053 --> 01:33:15,889
they get 16 sunrises and sunsets

2882
01:33:15,889 --> 01:33:16,690
every day.

2883
01:33:16,690 --> 01:33:18,659
And with all those sunsets,

2884
01:33:18,659 --> 01:33:21,261
nighttime can be particularly

2885
01:33:21,261 --> 01:33:22,529
stunning the way those urban

2886
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,431
areas pop with light.

2887
01:33:24,431 --> 01:33:25,732
Here we are flying over South

2888
01:33:25,732 --> 01:33:27,567
Korea toward Japan.

2889
01:33:27,567 --> 01:33:29,036
You can see Tokyo coming into

2890
01:33:29,036 --> 01:33:31,038
view at the top, some distant

2891
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:33,273
stars, and even upper reaches of

2892
01:33:33,273 --> 01:33:34,608
the Earth's atmosphere, which is

2893
01:33:34,608 --> 01:33:37,077
that orange band enveloping the

2894
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:38,211
Earth.

2895
01:33:41,148 --> 01:33:42,683
And here's one that might look a

2896
01:33:42,683 --> 01:33:43,950
little more familiar.

2897
01:33:43,950 --> 01:33:45,652
This is the Northern California

2898
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:47,888
coast heading southward.

2899
01:33:47,888 --> 01:33:49,056
You can see Lake Tahoe

2900
01:33:49,056 --> 01:33:51,658
surrounded by snowcaps and the

2901
01:33:51,658 --> 01:33:54,094
San Francisco Bay.

2902
01:33:54,094 --> 01:33:56,963
These are truly incredible and

2903
01:33:56,963 --> 01:33:58,699
offer such a unique perspective

2904
01:33:58,699 --> 01:33:59,700
on the world.

2905
01:33:59,700 --> 01:34:01,668

2908
01:34:05,172 --> 01:34:06,573
for all their help in making

2909
01:34:06,573 --> 01:34:08,475
this a possibility.

2911
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:15,716
These are going to look

2912
01:34:15,716 --> 01:34:20,554
incredible at home in 4K HDR.

2913
01:34:20,554 --> 01:34:21,655
So that's tvOS.

2914
01:34:21,655 --> 01:34:24,791
Apple TV gives you amazing

2915
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:27,527
picture and sound with 4K HDR

2916
01:34:27,527 --> 01:34:29,830
and now Dolby Atmos.

01:34:29,830 --> 01:34:31,498
And the Apple TV app is the

2918
01:34:31,498 --> 01:34:33,834
center of your video experience.

2919
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:36,303

We love the Mac.

2934
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:08,635
The Mac was the first computer

2935
01:35:08,635 --> 01:35:11,605
that made powerful technology so

2936
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:14,007
easy to use and put the customer

2937
01:35:14,007 --> 01:35:16,042
at the center of the experience.

2938
01:35:16,042 --> 01:35:17,711
And of course that remains at

2939
01:35:17,711 --> 01:35:19,346
the core of all Apple products.

2940
01:35:19,346 --> 01:35:23,550
For more than 30 years, the Mac

2941
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,519
has empowered people to create

2942
01:35:25,519 --> 01:35:28,889
all kinds of amazing things,

2943
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:31,124
from the personal to the

professional.

01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,694
Today, we're excited to take Mac

2946
01:35:34,694 --> 01:35:37,197
a huge leap forward.

2947
01:35:37,197 --> 01:35:39,132
The next version of macOS is

2948
01:35:39,132 --> 01:35:40,901

2955
01:35:55,048 --> 01:35:57,818
Hello again.

2956
01:35:57,818 --> 01:35:59,586
It's true that macOS is the

2957
01:35:59,586 --> 01:36:03,456
heart of what makes a Mac a Mac.

2958
01:36:03,456 --> 01:36:05,625
And we want as many Mac users as

2959
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:07,127
possible to have access to our

2960
01:36:07,127 --> 01:36:09,229
latest software, and that's why

2961
01:36:09,229 --> 01:36:10,831
six years ago with the

2962
01:36:10,831 --> 01:36:13,433
introduction of OS 10 Mavericks,

2963
01:36:13,433 --> 01:36:15,035
we began offering our macOS

2964
01:36:15,035 --> 01:36:17,504
updates free for Mac users.

2965
01:36:17,504 --> 01:36:19,606
And 2013 was also the year that

2966
01:36:19,606 --> 01:36:21,208
we first introduced our

2967
01:36:21,208 --> 01:36:24,010
California naming theme.

2968
01:36:24,010 --> 01:36:25,946
Now after spending a year by the

2969
01:36:25,946 --> 01:36:28,048
ocean, we not only modernized

2970
01:36:28,048 --> 01:36:30,383
the look and feel of macOS, but

2971
01:36:30,383 --> 01:36:32,185
we headed to the mountains with

2972
01:36:32,185 --> 01:36:35,222
macOS Yosemite.

2973
01:36:35,222 --> 01:36:38,058
Now, as you may be aware, our

2974
01:36:38,058 --> 01:36:39,626
naming of Mac releases is

2975
01:36:39,626 --> 01:36:41,595
handled by our crack marketing

2976
01:36:41,595 --> 01:36:44,731
organization, and as you've

2977
01:36:44,731 --> 01:36:46,733
probably noticed, they went on a

2978
01:36:46,733 --> 01:36:50,937
four-year mountain-bound bender.

2979
01:36:50,937 --> 01:36:52,172
[laughter] In El Capitan we

2980
01:36:52,172 --> 01:36:54,341
added metal, our ground-breaking

2981
01:36:54,341 --> 01:36:56,142
graphics technology.

2982
01:36:56,142 --> 01:36:57,677
In Sierra, we brought Siri to

2983
01:36:57,677 --> 01:36:58,945
the Mac and extended our

2984
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:01,181
capabilities and continuity.

2985
01:37:01,181 --> 01:37:03,583
And last year with High Sierra,

2986
01:37:03,583 --> 01:37:05,619
we focused on deep technology,

2987
01:37:05,619 --> 01:37:07,254
preparing the Mac for future

2988
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:08,521
innovation.

2989
01:37:08,521 --> 01:37:10,090
Well this year, we made some

2990
01:37:10,090 --> 01:37:13,193
striking changes to macOS, and

2991
01:37:13,193 --> 01:37:15,395
we've left the high country for

2992
01:37:15,395 --> 01:37:17,264
a place entirely different but

2993
01:37:17,264 --> 01:37:20,000
not less beautiful and here

2994
01:37:20,000 --> 01:37:22,002
still in California, and I'd

01:37:22,002 --> 01:37:24,104
like to take you there now.

2996
01:37:24,104 --> 01:37:30,143
Our next release of macOS is

2997
01:37:30,143 --> 01:37:33,480
macOS Mojave.

2998
01:37:33,480 --> 01:37:40,020
[ Applause ]

2999
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:41,922
Now, Mojave is beautiful during

3000
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:43,323
the day, but what really

3001
01:37:43,323 --> 01:37:45,458
captured our imagination was the

3002
01:37:45,458 --> 01:37:48,929
beauty of the desert at night.

3003
01:37:48,929 --> 01:37:52,532
And this inspired one of our

3004
01:37:52,532 --> 01:37:55,802
most distinctive new features,

3005
01:37:55,802 --> 01:38:00,573
and I'd like to show it to you

3006
01:38:00,573 --> 01:38:01,708
now.

3007
01:38:02,709 --> 01:38:06,112
So here we are live in macOS

3008
01:38:06,112 --> 01:38:09,215
Mojave, and I'd like to show you

3009
01:38:09,215 --> 01:38:11,985
a new side of Mojave.

3010
01:38:11,985 --> 01:38:15,455
We call it dark mode.

3011
01:38:15,455 --> 01:38:23,229
[ Applause ]

3012
01:38:23,229 --> 01:38:25,432
And as you see, dark mode is not

3013
01:38:25,432 --> 01:38:27,033
just about the dock or the menu

3014
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:27,801
bar.

3015
01:38:27,801 --> 01:38:28,635
It extends to your Windows

3016
01:38:28,635 --> 01:38:30,103
Chrome, your sidebar, and even

3017
01:38:30,103 --> 01:38:32,138
the content of the Windows, and

3018
01:38:32,138 --> 01:38:33,473
it's so great for Pros.

3019
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:35,675
It makes photographic content

3020
01:38:35,675 --> 01:38:38,611
absolutely pop off the screen.

3021
01:38:38,611 --> 01:38:40,847
It's just gorgeous.

3022
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:44,084
It's so nice.

3023
01:38:44,084 --> 01:38:46,353
And this is great not just for

3024
01:38:46,353 --> 01:38:48,688
photography but when working on

3025
01:38:48,688 --> 01:38:51,558
presentations or documents.

3026
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:53,126
It's also great doing ordinary

3027
01:38:53,126 --> 01:38:53,960
things.

3028
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:54,694
Maybe you're working in a dark

3029
01:38:54,694 --> 01:38:55,762
environment.

3030
01:38:55,762 --> 01:38:58,131
Just look at calendar.

3031
01:38:58,131 --> 01:39:00,767
Even mail in dark mode.

3032
01:39:00,767 --> 01:39:02,535
It's so great.

3033
01:39:02,535 --> 01:39:04,137
And I think some of us are going

3034
01:39:04,137 --> 01:39:05,372
to want to run dark mode just

3035
01:39:05,372 --> 01:39:07,240
because it's so cool.

3036
01:39:07,240 --> 01:39:09,743
I mean your emoji look great.

3037
01:39:09,743 --> 01:39:11,444
Your photos look great.

3038
01:39:11,444 --> 01:39:13,880
I mean check out your album art

in Apple Music.

3042
01:39:19,886 --> 01:39:21,287
going to especially appreciate

in this room, our developers,

3045
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:27,060
because Expo looks fantastic in

3046
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:28,461

even interface builder and all

of its inspectors, they just

3051

look fantastic in black.

And that's a quick look at dark

3053

mode.

3054
01:39:46,212 --> 01:39:49,616
Now, we were so inspired by this

3055
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:52,185
changing desktop wallpaper that

3056
01:39:52,185 --> 01:39:53,553
we decided to add a new feature

3057
01:39:53,553 --> 01:39:54,921
to Mojave that I think you'll

3058
01:39:54,921 --> 01:39:56,356
enjoy.

3059
01:39:56,356 --> 01:39:58,658
It's called dynamic desktop, and

3060
01:39:58,658 --> 01:39:59,559
when you're using it, you're

3061
01:39:59,559 --> 01:40:01,895
desktop actually subtly changes

3062
01:40:01,895 --> 01:40:04,697
throughout the day from morning,

3063
01:40:04,697 --> 01:40:08,401
to afternoon, to evening.

3064
01:40:08,401 --> 01:40:10,070
It's really cool.

3065
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:12,272
Now, there's much more to Mojave

3066
01:40:12,272 --> 01:40:15,141
that I'd like to share with you

3067
01:40:15,141 --> 01:40:17,610
through demos, and it starts

3068
01:40:17,610 --> 01:40:19,712
with the desktop.

3069
01:40:19,712 --> 01:40:23,416
Now, the desktop is so crucial

3070
01:40:23,416 --> 01:40:25,185
to how many of us use our Macs.

3071
01:40:25,185 --> 01:40:26,086
When we have files that we're

3072
01:40:26,086 --> 01:40:27,787
actively working on, we often

3073
01:40:27,787 --> 01:40:29,456
put them on the desktop, but the

3074
01:40:29,456 --> 01:40:31,491
result can be a desktop that

3075
01:40:31,491 --> 01:40:34,761
looks something like this.

3076
01:40:34,761 --> 01:40:36,296
And so now in Mojave we have a

3077
01:40:36,296 --> 01:40:38,398
really great solution, and we

3078
01:40:38,398 --> 01:40:42,202
call it Desktop Stacks.

3079

All of the contents of your

3081
01:40:48,808 --> 01:40:51,444
desktop are automatically

3082
01:40:51,444 --> 01:40:53,680
arranged into these stacks, and

3083
01:40:53,680 --> 01:40:56,683
they can be arranged by kind, by

3084
01:40:56,683 --> 01:40:58,985
date, or even by tag, and

3085
01:40:58,985 --> 01:41:00,320
they're really easy to use.

3086
01:41:00,320 --> 01:41:01,588
You just click on them.

3087
01:41:01,588 --> 01:41:02,889
You can see all the contents in

3088
01:41:02,889 --> 01:41:03,723
the stack.

3089
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:05,058
You can double click to open a

3090
01:41:05,058 --> 01:41:07,127
document and put it away.

3091
01:41:07,127 --> 01:41:09,262
And they stay organized.

3092
01:41:09,262 --> 01:41:10,763
So for instance, if I bring

3093
01:41:10,763 --> 01:41:12,732
forward mail, maybe I drag an

3094
01:41:12,732 --> 01:41:14,067
image out, I want you to watch

3095
01:41:14,067 --> 01:41:15,635
what happens because the image

3096
01:41:15,635 --> 01:41:17,770
flies right into the right

3097
01:41:17,770 --> 01:41:18,838
stack.

3098
01:41:18,838 --> 01:41:20,807
Now you can also scrub your

3099
01:41:20,807 --> 01:41:21,808
stacks.

3100
01:41:21,808 --> 01:41:22,976
So, for instance, I'll just

3101
01:41:22,976 --> 01:41:25,845
scrub across this stack.

3102
01:41:25,845 --> 01:41:27,714
You see I can select between

3103
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:30,783
different photos, pick one up.

3104
01:41:30,783 --> 01:41:32,018
Actually let me just hide mail

3105
01:41:32,018 --> 01:41:33,553
here mid drag.

3106
01:41:33,553 --> 01:41:36,523
I got a little excited with my,

3107
01:41:36,523 --> 01:41:39,726
with all of my stack action.

3108
01:41:39,726 --> 01:41:43,830
So I can just drag this out and

3109
01:41:43,830 --> 01:41:45,798
drop it in just like that.

3110
01:41:45,798 --> 01:41:47,700

3111
01:41:47,700 --> 01:41:48,568

01:41:48,568 --> 01:41:49,536

new changes to the finder.

now.

01:42:00,180 --> 01:42:04,217
Now it starts with a new view.

3119
01:42:04,217 --> 01:42:08,388
We all enjoy using icon view,

3120
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:09,355
list view.

3121
01:42:09,355 --> 01:42:11,357
There's of course column view,

3122
01:42:11,357 --> 01:42:13,693
but now we've added an all-new

3123
01:42:13,693 --> 01:42:15,662
view called gallery view.

3124
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:18,531
It has a big preview up top, a

3125
01:42:18,531 --> 01:42:19,832
set of thumbnails along the

3126
01:42:19,832 --> 01:42:21,634
bottom, and it makes it easy to

3127
01:42:21,634 --> 01:42:24,938
preview images, video,

3128
01:42:24,938 --> 01:42:28,041
presentations, documents,

3129
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:31,311
spreadsheets, PDFs, and of

3130
01:42:31,311 --> 01:42:33,580
course with images sometimes you

3131
01:42:33,580 --> 01:42:35,081
want to know more detail about,

3132
01:42:35,081 --> 01:42:35,949
for instance, how they were

3133
01:42:35,949 --> 01:42:37,350
captured, and now the new

3134
01:42:37,350 --> 01:42:40,153
sidebar in Mojave really helps

3135
01:42:40,153 --> 01:42:42,755
because it now supports full

3136
01:42:42,755 --> 01:42:45,058
metadata, so you can see around

3137
01:42:45,058 --> 01:42:47,393
your photo, the camera you took

3138
01:42:47,393 --> 01:42:50,029
the photo on, the kind of lens,

3139
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:51,864
the aperture settings, and so

3140
01:42:51,864 --> 01:42:52,498
forth.

3141
01:42:52,498 --> 01:42:53,499
It's really handy.

3142
01:42:53,499 --> 01:42:55,969
And you'll notice also along the

3143
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:57,237
bottom there's this new area

3144
01:42:57,237 --> 01:42:59,606
called Quick Actions, and Quick

current photo.

3147
01:43:02,308 --> 01:43:03,543
So, for instance, if I have a

3148
01:43:03,543 --> 01:43:05,278
photo like this and I want to

3149
01:43:05,278 --> 01:43:06,980
edit it, I don't have to open it

3150
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:08,448
and go through a new app.

3151
01:43:08,448 --> 01:43:10,450
I can rotate it right here

3152
01:43:10,450 --> 01:43:12,685
inside the finder.

3153
01:43:12,685 --> 01:43:14,220
It's really powerful.

3154
01:43:14,220 --> 01:43:15,755
Now this sidebar is available in

3155
01:43:15,755 --> 01:43:17,323
other views of the finder.

3156
01:43:17,323 --> 01:43:18,458
So for instance, I'm just going

3157
01:43:18,458 --> 01:43:19,726
to bring up the preview pane

3158
01:43:19,726 --> 01:43:21,094
here, and I'm going to do a

3159
01:43:21,094 --> 01:43:25,131
multi selection of a PDF as well

3160
01:43:25,131 --> 01:43:27,100
as several images, and you'll

3161
01:43:27,100 --> 01:43:28,334
notice that the quick actions

3162
01:43:28,334 --> 01:43:30,536
area is contextual, so it shows

3163
01:43:30,536 --> 01:43:33,106
me create PDF as an option.

3164
01:43:33,106 --> 01:43:34,407
I'm going to click create PDF,

3165
01:43:34,407 --> 01:43:36,175
and it's going to assemble all

3166
01:43:36,175 --> 01:43:38,244
of these photos into a PDF just

3167
01:43:38,244 --> 01:43:39,412
like that.

3168
01:43:39,412 --> 01:43:41,314
But what's really great is these

3169
01:43:41,314 --> 01:43:43,950
actions are also customizable,

3170
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:45,385
so you can create automator

3171
01:43:45,385 --> 01:43:47,453
actions and assign them to

3172
01:43:47,453 --> 01:43:50,556
buttons here inside of Finder.

3173
01:43:50,556 --> 01:43:51,624
So you'll notice that now that I

3174
01:43:51,624 --> 01:43:53,593
have this PDF selected, I have

3175
01:43:53,593 --> 01:43:55,428
an option to run a custom

3176
01:43:55,428 --> 01:43:56,596
automator action that I've

3177
01:43:56,596 --> 01:43:59,532
created called Watermark PDF.

3178
01:43:59,532 --> 01:44:01,200
When I click it, my custom

3179
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:04,237

3180
01:44:04,237 --> 01:44:06,906
watermarked, just like that.

3181
01:44:06,906 --> 01:44:08,408
And those are some quick

3182
01:44:08,408 --> 01:44:12,478
enhancements to the finder.

3183

[ Applause ]

3184
01:44:16,449 --> 01:44:18,217
Now a tool that I think many of

3185
01:44:18,217 --> 01:44:20,219
us love when working with files

3186
01:44:20,219 --> 01:44:21,587
is Quick Look, and now in

3187
01:44:21,587 --> 01:44:23,656
Mojave, we made Quick Look more

3188
01:44:23,656 --> 01:44:25,625
powerful than ever by

3189
01:44:25,625 --> 01:44:27,160
integrating Markup.

3190
01:44:27,160 --> 01:44:29,195
Let me show you how it works.

3191
01:44:29,195 --> 01:44:32,265
So you see down here I have a

3192
01:44:32,265 --> 01:44:34,167
permission slip and it's a PDF

3193
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:34,934
document.

3194
01:44:34,934 --> 01:44:36,035
I'm just going to hit tap

3195
01:44:36,035 --> 01:44:38,304
spacebar to Quick Look it, and

3196
01:44:38,304 --> 01:44:40,340
you notice now I have the option

3197
01:44:40,340 --> 01:44:42,775
to invoke Markup.

3198
01:44:42,775 --> 01:44:45,445
I click, and now I have access

3199
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:47,980
to my markup tools, including my

3200
01:44:47,980 --> 01:44:49,816
ability to sign this document.

3201
01:44:49,816 --> 01:44:52,051
I can just drag out my signature

3202
01:44:52,051 --> 01:44:55,555
like this, and I'm done.

3203
01:44:55,555 --> 01:44:57,957
Now this works for all kinds of

3204
01:44:57,957 --> 01:44:58,791
files.

3205
01:44:58,791 --> 01:45:00,793
So, for instance, with images I

3206
01:45:00,793 --> 01:45:04,097
can rotate and crop, and with

3207
01:45:04,097 --> 01:45:08,101
video I can even trim right here

3208
01:45:08,101 --> 01:45:09,502
inside of Quick Look.

3209
01:45:09,502 --> 01:45:11,838
And that's a quick look at Quick

3210
01:45:11,838 --> 01:45:12,472
Look.

3211
01:45:12,472 --> 01:45:17,343
[ Applause ]

3212
01:45:17,343 --> 01:45:18,378
Next, I want to talk about how

3213
01:45:18,378 --> 01:45:20,046
we capture content on our Mac

3214
01:45:20,046 --> 01:45:21,214
because one of the tools I think

3215
01:45:21,214 --> 01:45:22,949
many of us use all the time is

3216
01:45:22,949 --> 01:45:24,717
Screenshots, and we've made

3217
01:45:24,717 --> 01:45:26,652
Screenshots more powerful than

3218
01:45:26,652 --> 01:45:29,088
ever in Mohave.

3219
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:32,692
So let's take a look here at a

3220
01:45:32,692 --> 01:45:34,627
webpage, and I'm just going to

3221
01:45:34,627 --> 01:45:35,695
take a screenshot in the

3222
01:45:35,695 --> 01:45:36,462
traditional way.

3223
01:45:36,462 --> 01:45:37,430
I'm going to screen shot a

3224
01:45:37,430 --> 01:45:40,199
selection of the page, and I

3225
01:45:40,199 --> 01:45:41,234
want you to watch what happens

3226
01:45:41,234 --> 01:45:42,068
in the lower right.

3227
01:45:42,068 --> 01:45:44,871
I get a thumbnail instantly of

3228
01:45:44,871 --> 01:45:46,572
that screenshot, and when I

3229
01:45:46,572 --> 01:45:47,640
double click in, I get an

3230
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,976
accelerated workflow right into

3231
01:45:49,976 --> 01:45:51,444
Markup where I have access to

3232
01:45:51,444 --> 01:45:53,079
all of my tools.

3233
01:45:53,079 --> 01:45:54,414
So, for instance, if I want to

3234
01:45:54,414 --> 01:45:57,049
create a magnification here, I

3235
01:45:57,049 --> 01:46:01,454
can just drag that out.

3236
01:46:01,454 --> 01:46:04,724
Magnify. It's that easy.

3237
01:46:04,724 --> 01:46:06,159
But now we've also made it

3238
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:07,994
easier to access a variety of

3239
01:46:07,994 --> 01:46:09,929
tools, so when I bring up my

3240
01:46:09,929 --> 01:46:12,064
screenshotting, you see I'm

3241
01:46:12,064 --> 01:46:13,900
presented with this hud that

3242
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:15,134
tells me I can capture the

3243
01:46:15,134 --> 01:46:17,870
entire screen, a selected window

3244
01:46:17,870 --> 01:46:19,839
or selection, but we've also

3245
01:46:19,839 --> 01:46:22,775
added screen capture for video

3246
01:46:22,775 --> 01:46:24,811
right into screenshotting.

3247
01:46:24,811 --> 01:46:26,212
Let me show you how that works.

3248
01:46:26,212 --> 01:46:27,914
So I'm going to go to a webpage

3249
01:46:27,914 --> 01:46:29,415
here that has an animation

3250
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:30,116
running.

3251
01:46:30,116 --> 01:46:31,451
I'm going to bring up my

3252
01:46:31,451 --> 01:46:33,653
screenshotting tools, and say

3253
01:46:33,653 --> 01:46:36,456
record the selected area.

3254
01:46:36,456 --> 01:46:37,924
I'll just make a nice selection

3255
01:46:37,924 --> 01:46:39,158
here.

3256
01:46:39,158 --> 01:46:40,760
Okay. And I'm recording just

3257
01:46:40,760 --> 01:46:41,828
like that.

3258
01:46:41,828 --> 01:46:42,995
Of course I can manipulate the

3259
01:46:42,995 --> 01:46:45,364
app, so all will be reflected in

3260
01:46:45,364 --> 01:46:48,401
my recording, and when I'm done,

3261
01:46:48,401 --> 01:46:49,535
I can click the stop button

3262
01:46:49,535 --> 01:46:50,837
right up here.

3263
01:46:50,837 --> 01:46:51,804
And now you notice I have this

3264
01:46:51,804 --> 01:46:53,005
thumbnail in the lower right.

3265
01:46:53,005 --> 01:46:55,842
Well I can actually pick this up

3266
01:46:55,842 --> 01:46:57,844
and drag it into a new space and

3267
01:46:57,844 --> 01:46:59,846
incorporate it right into a

3268
01:46:59,846 --> 01:47:02,615
document, just like that.

3269
01:47:02,615 --> 01:47:04,183
Now, we've further enhanced the

3270
01:47:04,183 --> 01:47:06,385
way you capture content, and

3271
01:47:06,385 --> 01:47:09,055
that brings me to Continuity.

3272
01:47:09,055 --> 01:47:11,023
So Mac users love Continuity for

3273
01:47:11,023 --> 01:47:12,391
the way it lets us work across

3274
01:47:12,391 --> 01:47:15,261
our devices with things like Air

3275
01:47:15,261 --> 01:47:16,863
Drop or the ability to unlock

3276
01:47:16,863 --> 01:47:19,665
your Mac using your Apple Watch.

3277
01:47:19,665 --> 01:47:20,833
When it comes to capturing

3278
01:47:20,833 --> 01:47:22,802
content, we'll walk around with

3279
01:47:22,802 --> 01:47:24,170
one of the best content capture

01:47:24,170 --> 01:47:25,404

3281
01:47:25,404 --> 01:47:27,607
pockets, our phones.

3282
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:29,075
And so we wanted to take

3283
01:47:29,075 --> 01:47:30,776
advantage of continuity to bring

3284
01:47:30,776 --> 01:47:32,078
that to the Mac with a feature

3285
01:47:32,078 --> 01:47:34,180
we call Continuity Camera.

3286
01:47:34,180 --> 01:47:37,717
Let me show you how it works.

3287
01:47:37,717 --> 01:47:39,252
So here in my Keynote

3288
01:47:39,252 --> 01:47:41,387
presentation, I have a space

3289
01:47:41,387 --> 01:47:42,955
that's just waiting for a new

3290
01:47:42,955 --> 01:47:44,824
photo, and on my phone right

3291
01:47:44,824 --> 01:47:46,292
here.

3292
01:47:46,292 --> 01:47:47,927
Well, when I select this object,

3293
01:47:47,927 --> 01:47:50,630
I can choose to take a photo.

3294
01:47:50,630 --> 01:47:51,797
And I want you to watch what

3295
01:47:51,797 --> 01:47:53,065
happens when I select this to my

3296
01:47:53,065 --> 01:47:54,033
phone.

3297
01:47:54,033 --> 01:47:56,068
It automatically immediately

3298
01:47:56,068 --> 01:47:59,705
lights up ready to take a photo.

3299
01:47:59,705 --> 01:48:03,743
So I can take one like this, and

3300
01:48:03,743 --> 01:48:06,712
when I do, I can select use

3301
01:48:06,712 --> 01:48:08,681
photo, and it apps directly in

3302
01:48:08,681 --> 01:48:09,382
my document.

3303
01:48:09,382 --> 01:48:10,449

3305
01:48:15,187 --> 01:48:16,222

01:48:16,222 --> 01:48:18,090
scanning documents.

3307
01:48:18,090 --> 01:48:19,425
So here I have a place where I

3308
01:48:19,425 --> 01:48:21,327
could use a scan.

3309
01:48:21,327 --> 01:48:23,963

3310
01:48:23,963 --> 01:48:25,898
from the menu and this time scan

3311
01:48:25,898 --> 01:48:26,732

3312
01:48:26,732 --> 01:48:28,634
Again, my camera lights up, this

3313
01:48:28,634 --> 01:48:29,869

01:48:29,869 --> 01:48:31,003
scanner.

3315
01:48:31,003 --> 01:48:32,204
I just scan like this.

3316
01:48:32,204 --> 01:48:35,575
I can save it.

3317
01:48:35,575 --> 01:48:37,543
And my scan goes immediately,

3318
01:48:37,543 --> 01:48:39,912

3319
01:48:39,912 --> 01:48:40,713

3385
01:51:00,152 --> 01:51:01,821
Next, I'd like to talk about

3386
01:51:01,821 --> 01:51:03,823
security and privacy.

3387
01:51:03,823 --> 01:51:05,958
You know, one of the reasons

3388
01:51:05,958 --> 01:51:07,293
that people choose Apple

3389
01:51:07,293 --> 01:51:08,761
products is because of our

3390
01:51:08,761 --> 01:51:10,596
commitment to security and

3391
01:51:10,596 --> 01:51:11,964
privacy.

3392
01:51:11,964 --> 01:51:14,300
And we believe that your private

3393
01:51:14,300 --> 01:51:16,736
data should remain private, not

3394
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,137
because you've done something

3395
01:51:18,137 --> 01:51:19,338
wrong or that you have something

3396
01:51:19,338 --> 01:51:21,073
to hide but because there can be

3397
01:51:21,073 --> 01:51:22,942
a lot of sensitive data on your

3398
01:51:22,942 --> 01:51:24,910
devices, and we think you should

3399
01:51:24,910 --> 01:51:27,546
be in control of who sees it.

3400
01:51:27,546 --> 01:51:29,548
Now, to begin we protect your

3401
01:51:29,548 --> 01:51:32,084
information on your devices

3402
01:51:32,084 --> 01:51:34,320
using state of the art hardware

3403
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:36,489
and software, and this year

3404
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:38,557
we're adding greater protections

3405
01:51:38,557 --> 01:51:40,326
about how apps can access that

3406
01:51:40,326 --> 01:51:42,027
information.

3407
01:51:42,027 --> 01:51:44,163
Today, Apple devices check in

3408
01:51:44,163 --> 01:51:45,765
with you before granting an app

3409
01:51:45,765 --> 01:51:47,733
access to information like your

3410
01:51:47,733 --> 01:51:49,001
location.

3411
01:51:49,001 --> 01:51:50,169
You could tell because you'll

3412
01:51:50,169 --> 01:51:52,071
see an alert just like this one,

3413
01:51:52,071 --> 01:51:54,140
and macOS already provides

3414
01:51:54,140 --> 01:51:56,609
API-level protections for things

3415
01:51:56,609 --> 01:51:59,245
like contacts, photos, calendar,

3416
01:51:59,245 --> 01:52:00,780
and reminders, but now in

3417
01:52:00,780 --> 01:52:02,848
Mojave, we're extending these

3418
01:52:02,848 --> 01:52:04,984
protections to include your

3419
01:52:04,984 --> 01:52:07,820
camera and your microphone as

3420
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:09,155
well as protecting sensitive

3421
01:52:09,155 --> 01:52:10,756
parts of your file system, like

3422
01:52:10,756 --> 01:52:12,525

default for any app that you run

3426
01:52:19,231 --> 01:52:20,332
on the system, an important

3427
01:52:20,332 --> 01:52:22,501

Next, I want to turn to some

3430
01:52:28,107 --> 01:52:30,409
great enhancements to Safari.

3431
01:52:30,409 --> 01:52:32,278
Safari works really hard to

3432
01:52:32,278 --> 01:52:33,846
protect your privacy, and this

3433
01:52:33,846 --> 01:52:36,115
year it's working even harder.

3434
01:52:36,115 --> 01:52:37,850
Last year, we introduced

3435
01:52:37,850 --> 01:52:39,919
intelligent tracking prevention

3436
01:52:39,919 --> 01:52:41,554
to dramatically reduce the

3437
01:52:41,554 --> 01:52:43,455
ability for apps to track you

3438
01:52:43,455 --> 01:52:46,625
across websites using cookies.

3439
01:52:46,625 --> 01:52:47,560
This is the kind of thing where

3440
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,961
you look at a product on one

3441
01:52:48,961 --> 01:52:49,795
site.

3442
01:52:49,795 --> 01:52:51,397
Then you move to another site

3443
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:53,098
and another site and somehow

3444
01:52:53,098 --> 01:52:54,166
this is just following you

3445
01:52:54,166 --> 01:52:56,235
wherever you go.

3446
01:52:56,235 --> 01:52:58,170

3451
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,780
used to track you, whether you

3452
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:10,482
click on them or not, and so

3453
01:53:10,482 --> 01:53:12,451
this year we are shutting that

3454
01:53:12,451 --> 01:53:14,486

Now next let's talk about

3463
01:53:37,209 --> 01:53:38,477
Fingerprinting.

3464
01:53:38,477 --> 01:53:40,779
You know, data companies are

3465
01:53:40,779 --> 01:53:43,115
clever and relentless, and in

3466
01:53:43,115 --> 01:53:45,951
addition to cookies, they use

3467
01:53:45,951 --> 01:53:47,019
another method called

3468
01:53:47,019 --> 01:53:48,254
Fingerprinting.

And here's how it works.

3470
01:53:49,855 --> 01:53:51,357
Just like you can be identified

3471
01:53:51,357 --> 01:53:53,525
by a fingerprint, it turns out

3472
01:53:53,525 --> 01:53:55,828
that when you browse the web,

3473
01:53:55,828 --> 01:53:57,496
you're device can be identify by

3474
01:53:57,496 --> 01:53:59,965
a unique set of characteristics,

3475
01:53:59,965 --> 01:54:02,368
like its configuration, its

3476
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,003
fonts that you have installed

3477
01:54:04,003 --> 01:54:05,638
and the plug-insulin that you

3478
01:54:05,638 --> 01:54:06,639
might have on the device.

3479
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,607
And these data companies can use

3480
01:54:08,607 --> 01:54:10,109
the set of characteristics to

3481
01:54:10,109 --> 01:54:12,311
construct a unique fingerprint

3482
01:54:12,311 --> 01:54:14,480
to track your device from site

3483
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,615
to site.

3484
01:54:16,615 --> 01:54:17,850
With Mojave, we're making it

3485
01:54:17,850 --> 01:54:20,185
much harder for trackers to

3486
01:54:20,185 --> 01:54:21,987

3491

fonts, and Legacy plug-insulin

3492
01:54:30,396 --> 01:54:31,397
are no longer supported, so

3493
01:54:31,397 --> 01:54:32,765
those can't contribute to a

3494
01:54:32,765 --> 01:54:34,733

3495
01:54:34,733 --> 01:54:36,635

01:56:28,414 --> 01:56:30,516
a place organized around those

3553
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:31,550
themes.

3554
01:56:31,550 --> 01:56:33,852
So we've redesigned an all new

3555
01:56:33,852 --> 01:56:35,687
Mac App Store from the ground

3556
01:56:35,687 --> 01:56:37,656
up, and we're thrilled to show

3557
01:56:37,656 --> 01:56:38,490
it to you now.

01:56:38,490 --> 01:56:46,131
[ Applause ]

3559
01:56:46,131 --> 01:56:47,299
It's got a beautiful UI that

3560
01:56:47,299 --> 01:56:49,535
should feel familiar but new and

3561
01:56:49,535 --> 01:56:51,170
designed first and foremost to

3562
01:56:51,170 --> 01:56:53,338
be a great Mac app.

3563
01:56:53,338 --> 01:56:54,506
Starting with the new discover

3564
01:56:54,506 --> 01:56:56,775
tab where each week you can find

3565
01:56:56,775 --> 01:56:58,911
in-depth editorial about the

3566
01:56:58,911 --> 01:57:01,013
best Mac apps through stories

3567
01:57:01,013 --> 01:57:03,348
and collections and see what's

3568
01:57:03,348 --> 01:57:06,652
most popular with top charts.

3569
01:57:06,652 --> 01:57:08,754
Here's a story about musician

3570
01:57:08,754 --> 01:57:11,023
and founder Karim Morsy.

3571
01:57:11,023 --> 01:57:13,559

3573
01:57:15,928 --> 01:57:18,097
for your own set.

Helpful videos auto play, so you

3575
01:57:20,399 --> 01:57:22,234
can see what apps are capable of

3576
01:57:22,234 --> 01:57:25,003
before downloading them.

3577
01:57:25,003 --> 01:57:28,006
Visit the all-new create, work,

3578

3579
01:57:30,442 --> 01:57:31,477
you'll find helpful

around each theme.

3582
01:57:36,682 --> 01:57:37,816
Here's the create tab where you

3583
01:57:37,816 --> 01:57:39,418
can find apps that bring your

3584
01:57:39,418 --> 01:57:41,787
artistic ideas to light.

3585
01:57:41,787 --> 01:57:43,455
These tabs will also help you

3586
01:57:43,455 --> 01:57:44,890
make the most of apps you might

3587
01:57:44,890 --> 01:57:46,625
already have with tips and

3588
01:57:46,625 --> 01:57:48,560
tutorials even the most expert

3589
01:57:48,560 --> 01:57:51,063
users will find useful.

3590
01:57:51,063 --> 01:57:55,534
The work, play, and develop tabs

3591
01:57:55,534 --> 01:57:57,736
share the same beautiful design,

3592
01:57:57,736 --> 01:57:59,037
and you can still browse by

3593
01:57:59,037 --> 01:58:03,041
category on the categories tab.

3594
01:58:03,041 --> 01:58:04,676
We've redesigned product pages

3595
01:58:04,676 --> 01:58:06,745
too, bringing many features over

3596
01:58:06,745 --> 01:58:08,680
from iOS based on our learnings

3597
01:58:08,680 --> 01:58:09,515
there.

3598
01:58:09,515 --> 01:58:11,416
It has more useful information

3599
01:58:11,416 --> 01:58:13,418
like video previews available on

3600
01:58:13,418 --> 01:58:14,920

3601
01:58:14,920 --> 01:58:17,389
time, an apps rank if it's

3602
01:58:17,389 --> 01:58:18,690

3604
01:58:20,125 --> 01:58:23,028
Ratings and reviews are now

3605
01:58:23,028 --> 01:58:25,197
front and center, and these are

3606
01:58:25,197 --> 01:58:27,266
so important for app discovery.

3607
01:58:27,266 --> 01:58:29,134
So we're introducing a ratings

3608
01:58:29,134 --> 01:58:32,004
and review API for Mac apps.

3609
01:58:32,004 --> 01:58:33,872

for people to leave feedback.

3611
01:58:36,808 --> 01:58:38,410
We're really excited about the

3612
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:40,179
all-new Mac App Store.

3613
01:58:40,179 --> 01:58:41,480
We've talked to some developers

3614
01:58:41,480 --> 01:58:42,814
already, and they're really

3615
01:58:42,814 --> 01:58:44,249
excited too.

01:58:44,249 --> 01:58:46,351
Like Microsoft, who will bring

3617
01:58:46,351 --> 01:58:48,820
Office 365 to the Mac App Store

3618
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:50,489
later this year.

[ Applause ]

3632
01:59:23,455 --> 01:59:24,990
So we think the Mac App Store is

3633
01:59:24,990 --> 01:59:26,558
going to inspire whole-new

3634
01:59:26,558 --> 01:59:28,527
generations of apps, and so we

3635
01:59:28,527 --> 01:59:29,895
want to talk about some of the

3636
01:59:29,895 --> 01:59:32,698
technologies that will be behind

3637
01:59:32,698 --> 01:59:34,766
some of that next generation.

3638
01:59:34,766 --> 01:59:36,768
We spoke earlier about ARKit.

3639
01:59:36,768 --> 01:59:39,671
I want to talk about two more.

3640
01:59:39,671 --> 01:59:42,341
And let's start with Metal.

3641
01:59:42,341 --> 01:59:43,976
Now Metal is the technology to

3642
01:59:43,976 --> 01:59:45,410
get the highest performance

3643
01:59:45,410 --> 01:59:47,613
graphics and computation from

3644
01:59:47,613 --> 01:59:49,281
graphics processors.

3645
01:59:49,281 --> 01:59:50,949
Metal was designed for modern

3646
01:59:50,949 --> 01:59:51,783
GPUs.

3647
01:59:51,783 --> 01:59:54,219
It's incredibly efficient, and

3648
01:59:54,219 --> 01:59:55,320
that enables amazing

3649
01:59:55,320 --> 01:59:57,055
console-level games like

3650
01:59:57,055 --> 01:59:59,524
Fortnight from Epic to run great

3651
01:59:59,524 --> 02:00:02,628
for the first time on mobile.

3652
02:00:02,628 --> 02:00:04,263
But Metal also enables these

3653
02:00:04,263 --> 02:00:06,732
games to scale to take full

3654
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:09,368
advantage of modern Macs.

3655
02:00:09,368 --> 02:00:11,536
In fact, across iOS and the Mac,

3656
02:00:11,536 --> 02:00:13,438
there are over one billion

3657
02:00:13,438 --> 02:00:16,608
Metal-enabled devices, and we're

3658
02:00:16,608 --> 02:00:18,944
constantly making Metal better.

3659
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:20,812
To bring the highest GPU

3660
02:00:20,812 --> 02:00:22,914
performance in reach of all

3661
02:00:22,914 --> 02:00:24,082
Macs, we've recently added

3662
02:00:24,082 --> 02:00:28,687
support for external GPUs, and

3663
02:00:28,687 --> 02:00:30,422
this is powered by Metal, and

3664
02:00:30,422 --> 02:00:31,890
the results are truly mind

3665
02:00:31,890 --> 02:00:32,891
boggling.

3666
02:00:32,891 --> 02:00:35,127
For instance, running a filter

3667
02:00:35,127 --> 02:00:36,828
in DaVinci Resolve, look at how

3668
02:00:36,828 --> 02:00:38,897
it scales on the incredibly fast

3669
02:00:38,897 --> 02:00:41,800
iMac Pro as you add up to four

3670
02:00:41,800 --> 02:00:42,634
eGPUs.

3671
02:00:42,634 --> 02:00:45,070
Now, the results are even more

3672
02:00:45,070 --> 02:00:46,371
staggering when you take a

3673
02:00:46,371 --> 02:00:48,507
13-inch MacBook Pro and add

3674
02:00:48,507 --> 02:00:51,843
eGPUs to it, achieving up to 8.5

3675
02:00:51,843 --> 02:00:53,245
times speedup.

3676
02:00:53,245 --> 02:00:55,414
It's pretty awesome.

3677
02:00:55,414 --> 02:00:57,649
Now, eGPUs also enable Macs to

3678
02:00:57,649 --> 02:00:58,984
achieve all-new levels of

3679
02:00:58,984 --> 02:01:00,852
performance and realism in 3D

3680
02:01:00,852 --> 02:01:02,821
rendering and gaming.

3681
02:01:02,821 --> 02:01:04,256
Now this beautiful forest you

3682
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:06,091
see here, this isn't a video

02:01:09,661 --> 02:01:11,596
the Dead interactive demo, and

3686
02:01:11,596 --> 02:01:13,832
it's being rendered live right

3687
02:01:13,832 --> 02:01:16,935
now on a MacBook with an eGPU

02:01:16,935 --> 02:01:18,637
powering this display.

3689
02:01:18,637 --> 02:01:19,771
I mean doesn't this look

3690
02:01:19,771 --> 02:01:20,505
amazing?

[ Applause ]

3692
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:27,012
Now, of course because this is

3693
02:01:27,012 --> 02:01:29,014
rendered live, we can check

3694
02:01:29,014 --> 02:01:30,449
what's up ahead, so let's start

3695
02:01:30,449 --> 02:01:32,217
walking.

3696
02:01:32,217 --> 02:01:33,952
Now Unity is using Metal's

3697
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:36,655
unified graphics and compute to

3698
02:01:36,655 --> 02:01:39,124
generate real-time lighting and

3699
02:01:39,124 --> 02:01:43,195
complex post-processing effects.

3700
02:01:43,195 --> 02:01:46,832
So cool. And that's all rendered

3701
02:01:46,832 --> 02:01:49,101

3702
02:01:49,101 --> 02:01:50,102
an eGPU.

3703
02:01:50,102 --> 02:01:51,536
It's pretty great.

learning.

3709
02:02:02,214 --> 02:02:04,850
And today ML specialists usually

3710
02:02:04,850 --> 02:02:07,319
use one of these third-party

3711
02:02:07,319 --> 02:02:09,187
libraries to train their models

3712
02:02:09,187 --> 02:02:11,356
using servers, and now it turns

3713
02:02:11,356 --> 02:02:13,291
out we can accelerate tools like

3714
02:02:13,291 --> 02:02:14,459
this with our new Metal

3715
02:02:14,459 --> 02:02:16,027
performance shaders.

3716
02:02:16,027 --> 02:02:17,596
We're seeing speedups of up to

3717
02:02:17,596 --> 02:02:20,165
20 times and using the GPU with

3718
02:02:20,165 --> 02:02:21,600

3721
02:02:23,802 --> 02:02:25,437
up is great, we actually thing

3722
02:02:25,437 --> 02:02:26,905
there's a better way for most

3738
02:02:55,333 --> 02:02:56,768
Playgrounds to train your model.

3739
02:02:56,768 --> 02:02:58,870
Just drag one in, you're

3740
02:02:58,870 --> 02:03:00,272
training set, you can drag in

3741
02:03:00,272 --> 02:03:01,973
your test set as well, and the

3742
02:03:01,973 --> 02:03:03,809
training is all GPU accelerated,

3743
02:03:03,809 --> 02:03:06,278
so it's incredibly fast.

3744
02:03:06,278 --> 02:03:07,913
Now, as an example, we worked

3745
02:03:07,913 --> 02:03:09,114
with Memrise.

3746
02:03:09,114 --> 02:03:10,816
They're a developer who uses the

3747
02:03:10,816 --> 02:03:13,018
camera to identify objects and

3748
02:03:13,018 --> 02:03:13,852
speak them in multiple

3749
02:03:13,852 --> 02:03:15,987
languages, and in the past, they

3750
02:03:15,987 --> 02:03:16,888
would train their model with

3751
02:03:16,888 --> 02:03:18,723
20,000 images, and it would take

3752
02:03:18,723 --> 02:03:21,827
them 24 hours to do so.

3753
02:03:21,827 --> 02:03:23,895
Well now with Create ML, they

3754
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:27,232
can train that same model in 48

3755
02:03:27,232 --> 02:03:29,501
minutes on a MacBook Pro.

[ Applause ]

3757
02:03:34,539 --> 02:03:37,175
And on iMac Pro, it's just 18

3758
02:03:37,175 --> 02:03:38,009
minutes.

3759
02:03:38,009 --> 02:03:39,444
And what's even more incredible

3760
02:03:39,444 --> 02:03:41,046
is that model in the past for

3761
02:03:41,046 --> 02:03:43,482
them was 90 megabytes, and now

3762
02:03:43,482 --> 02:03:45,550
it's just three megabytes.

3763
02:03:45,550 --> 02:03:48,520
It's a huge difference.

[ Applause ]

3765
02:03:52,224 --> 02:03:53,959
Now we also are making models

3766
02:03:53,959 --> 02:03:55,894
run much faster on device using

3767
02:03:55,894 --> 02:03:56,962
Core ML 2.

3768
02:03:56,962 --> 02:03:58,530
Now Core ML is our technology

3769
02:03:58,530 --> 02:04:00,131
for high performance on-device

3770
02:04:00,131 --> 02:04:01,800
machine learning, and now it's

3771
02:04:01,800 --> 02:04:03,468
better than ever.

3772
02:04:03,468 --> 02:04:05,070
It's 30 percent faster in

3773
02:04:05,070 --> 02:04:06,638
on-device processing using a

3774
02:04:06,638 --> 02:04:07,772
technique called batch

3775
02:04:07,772 --> 02:04:09,808
predictions, and you can reduce

3776
02:04:09,808 --> 02:04:12,043
your model size by up to 75

3777
02:04:12,043 --> 02:04:14,646
percent using quantization.

3778
02:04:14,646 --> 02:04:17,983
And so that's Core ML and Create

3779
02:04:17,983 --> 02:04:18,783
ML.

3780
02:04:18,783 --> 02:04:19,784
You no longer have to be an

3781
02:04:19,784 --> 02:04:22,521
expert in machine learning to

3782
02:04:22,521 --> 02:04:25,223
build those techniques into your

3783
02:04:25,223 --> 02:04:26,024
app.

3784
02:04:26,024 --> 02:04:27,526
Now, these technologies are

3785
02:04:27,526 --> 02:04:29,060
redefining what's possible in

3786
02:04:29,060 --> 02:04:31,963

3787
02:04:31,963 --> 02:04:34,032
just to macOS but also to iOS,

3788
02:04:34,032 --> 02:04:36,034
and the fact that the mac and

3789
02:04:36,034 --> 02:04:39,070
iOS share so much technology has

3790
02:04:39,070 --> 02:04:41,706
led people almost every year to

3791
02:04:41,706 --> 02:04:44,342
keep asking us the question, are

3792
02:04:44,342 --> 02:04:47,746
you merging iOS and macOS?

3793
02:04:47,746 --> 02:04:49,714
So I'd like to take a moment to

3794
02:04:49,714 --> 02:04:52,183
briefly address this question.

3795
02:04:52,183 --> 02:04:55,520
No. Of course not.

[ Applause ]

3797
02:05:00,792 --> 02:05:02,661
We love the Mac because it's,

3798
02:05:02,661 --> 02:05:04,262
and we love macOS because it's

3799
02:05:04,262 --> 02:05:07,966
explicitly created that a unique

3800
02:05:07,966 --> 02:05:10,135
characteristics of Mac hardware,

3801
02:05:10,135 --> 02:05:11,636
like the ergonomics of the

3802
02:05:11,636 --> 02:05:13,505
keyboard and the trackpad, the

3803
02:05:13,505 --> 02:05:15,440
flexibility in displays and

3804
02:05:15,440 --> 02:05:17,375
storage and because of the power

3805
02:05:17,375 --> 02:05:18,076
it exposes.

3806
02:05:18,076 --> 02:05:19,010
It makes the Mac able to

3807
02:05:19,010 --> 02:05:21,212
accomplish almost anything.

3808
02:05:21,212 --> 02:05:22,881
So we think that this question

3809
02:05:22,881 --> 02:05:24,149
is actually coming from

3810
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:26,017
something else.

3811
02:05:26,017 --> 02:05:28,086
You know, Mac users have access

3812
02:05:28,086 --> 02:05:30,989
to a rich set of great native

3813
02:05:30,989 --> 02:05:32,991
applications, apps that take

3814
02:05:32,991 --> 02:05:35,060
full advantage of the power of

3815
02:05:35,060 --> 02:05:36,761
Mac technologies.

3816
02:05:36,761 --> 02:05:38,997
But Mac users also use apps

3817
02:05:38,997 --> 02:05:40,865
based on other technologies.

3818
02:05:40,865 --> 02:05:42,734
We routinely access web-based

3819
02:05:42,734 --> 02:05:44,603
experiences like Netflix that

3820
02:05:44,603 --> 02:05:46,638
build on WebKit, the

3821
02:05:46,638 --> 02:05:48,406
standards-based web technology

3822
02:05:48,406 --> 02:05:50,642
in Safari, and we also run

3823
02:05:50,642 --> 02:05:53,144
sometimes cross-platform games

3824
02:05:53,144 --> 02:05:55,780
built on technology like metal.

3825
02:05:55,780 --> 02:05:58,817
And all of these platforms

3826
02:05:58,817 --> 02:06:00,085
enrich the Mac user's

3827
02:06:00,085 --> 02:06:01,353
experience.

3828
02:06:01,353 --> 02:06:02,954
But we think there's room for

3829
02:06:02,954 --> 02:06:05,090
one more, and so we'd like to

3830
02:06:05,090 --> 02:06:06,591
give you a sneak peek of a

3831
02:06:06,591 --> 02:06:08,627
multiyear project we have going

3832
02:06:08,627 --> 02:06:09,361
on.

3833
02:06:09,361 --> 02:06:10,795
Because we see a huge

3834
02:06:10,795 --> 02:06:12,330
opportunity for the Mac to tap

3835
02:06:12,330 --> 02:06:14,065
into the world's most vital app

3836
02:06:14,065 --> 02:06:15,634
ecosystem.

3837
02:06:15,634 --> 02:06:16,701
It's called iOS.

3838
02:06:16,701 --> 02:06:18,269
I think you might be familiar

3839
02:06:18,269 --> 02:06:19,270
with it.

3840
02:06:19,270 --> 02:06:21,072
Now, there are millions of iOS

3841
02:06:21,072 --> 02:06:22,607
apps out there, and we think

3842
02:06:22,607 --> 02:06:24,175
some of them would be absolutely

3843
02:06:24,175 --> 02:06:26,845
great on the Mac, and Mac users

3844
02:06:26,845 --> 02:06:28,380
would love to have them there.

3845
02:06:28,380 --> 02:06:30,915
And from a technical standpoint,

3846
02:06:30,915 --> 02:06:32,417
it's actually a really good fit

3847
02:06:32,417 --> 02:06:34,452
because from day one iOS and

3848
02:06:34,452 --> 02:06:35,854
macOS have shared common

3849
02:06:35,854 --> 02:06:37,522
foundations.

3850
02:06:37,522 --> 02:06:39,591
But iOS devices and Mac devices

3851
02:06:39,591 --> 02:06:40,992
of course are different, and the

3852
02:06:40,992 --> 02:06:42,594
user interfaces are somewhat

3853
02:06:42,594 --> 02:06:44,029
different and so the frameworks

3854
02:06:44,029 --> 02:06:45,330
underneath are as well.

3855
02:06:45,330 --> 02:06:46,831
And that makes today porting an

3856
02:06:46,831 --> 02:06:49,000
app from one to the other some

3857
02:06:49,000 --> 02:06:50,268
work.

3858
02:06:50,268 --> 02:06:51,836
We wanted to make this much

3859
02:06:51,836 --> 02:06:54,739
easier, and so we've taken some

3860
02:06:54,739 --> 02:06:57,509
key frameworks from iOS and

3861
02:06:57,509 --> 02:06:59,544
brought them to the Mac.

3862
02:06:59,544 --> 02:07:00,945
And we've adapted them to

3863
02:07:00,945 --> 02:07:02,747
specific Mac behaviors like use

3864
02:07:02,747 --> 02:07:05,016
of trackpad and mouse, window

3865
02:07:05,016 --> 02:07:07,185
resizing, integration of things

3866
02:07:07,185 --> 02:07:08,953
like copy and paste and drag and

3867
02:07:08,953 --> 02:07:10,588
drop into the system services on

3868
02:07:10,588 --> 02:07:11,890
the mac.

3869
02:07:11,890 --> 02:07:14,626
Now, phase one of this effort is

3870
02:07:14,626 --> 02:07:16,728
to test it on ourselves.

3871
02:07:16,728 --> 02:07:18,396
So this year in macOS, we've

3872
02:07:18,396 --> 02:07:22,067
taken some of our own iOS apps,

3873
02:07:22,067 --> 02:07:23,635
and we brought them to the Mac

3874
02:07:23,635 --> 02:07:25,103
using those technologies to make

3875
02:07:25,103 --> 02:07:26,638
sure it works well.

3876
02:07:26,638 --> 02:07:27,605
You've actually heard about

3877
02:07:27,605 --> 02:07:29,441
several of them earlier today,

3878
02:07:29,441 --> 02:07:33,211
and it turns out they make

3879
02:07:33,211 --> 02:07:35,413
fantastic Mac apps, and we're

3880
02:07:35,413 --> 02:07:37,549
able to bring them to the Mac

3881
02:07:37,549 --> 02:07:40,085
with very few code changes.

3882
02:07:40,085 --> 02:07:41,586
Now, this is going to be coming

3883
02:07:41,586 --> 02:07:44,489
to you developers next year.

3884
02:07:44,489 --> 02:07:46,357
So you can easily bring your iOS

3885
02:07:46,357 --> 02:07:48,226

3899

want them there.

3975
02:11:11,930 --> 02:11:13,765

books.

3977
02:11:14,599 --> 02:11:16,668
He stayed in his bedroom, making

3978
02:11:16,668 --> 02:11:18,169
games while the other kids were

3979
02:11:18,169 --> 02:11:19,037
outside playing.

to tell my daughter to stop,

I want to get this solved first.

3987
02:11:29,047 --> 02:11:30,915
When I watch him code, his

3988
02:11:30,915 --> 02:11:34,886
eyes move in a weird way, and

3989
02:11:34,886 --> 02:11:37,255
he's like totally focused.

3990
02:11:37,255 --> 02:11:38,823
Even when my friends are over,

3991
02:11:38,823 --> 02:11:39,724

And they'd go, wow.

3994
02:11:45,063 --> 02:11:46,064
When he first came to us with

3995
02:11:46,064 --> 02:11:48,566
the idea, we were like, okay,

3996
02:11:48,566 --> 02:11:50,501
good luck.

3997
02:11:50,501 --> 02:11:51,936
He started off in his small

3998
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,004
little one-bedroom apartment

3999
02:11:53,004 --> 02:11:54,605
with next to nothing,

4000
02:11:54,605 --> 02:11:56,708
and sacrificed eating a burger

4001
02:11:56,708 --> 02:11:58,176
and just have ramen just so that

4002
02:11:58,176 --> 02:12:00,645
he could, and I'm like just buy

4003
02:12:00,645 --> 02:12:01,479
the burger.

4004
02:12:01,479 --> 02:12:02,313
And he's like no, that's three

4005
02:12:02,313 --> 02:12:03,414
bucks that I could put towards

4006
02:12:03,414 --> 02:12:04,248
the app.

4007
02:12:04,248 --> 02:12:06,117
Jeremy went out to build the

4008
02:12:06,117 --> 02:12:07,385
first version of Yelp, and it

4009
02:12:07,385 --> 02:12:08,653
was a total bust, a total

4010
02:12:08,653 --> 02:12:09,487
failure.

4011
02:12:09,487 --> 02:12:11,689
She tried really hard on a

4012
02:12:11,689 --> 02:12:13,624
couple different titles, and

4013
02:12:13,624 --> 02:12:14,792
you've never heard of them.

4014
02:12:14,792 --> 02:12:16,527
And, you know, that's a really

4015
02:12:16,527 --> 02:12:17,328
rough feeling.

4016
02:12:17,328 --> 02:12:18,930
That was definitely a low

4017
02:12:18,930 --> 02:12:20,565
point for Jeremy because it was

4018
02:12:20,565 --> 02:12:22,734
like, hey we got to retool and

4019
02:12:22,734 --> 02:12:23,568
try again.

4020
02:12:23,568 --> 02:12:25,136
What Jeremy did notice in the

4021
02:12:25,136 --> 02:12:26,537
data was that people loved

4022
02:12:26,537 --> 02:12:28,373
writing comments, and that was

4023
02:12:28,373 --> 02:12:30,041
really the genesis of the second

4024
02:12:30,041 --> 02:12:32,076
version of Yelp, which worked.

4025
02:12:32,076 --> 02:12:33,644
You have to be really okay

4026
02:12:33,644 --> 02:12:35,179
with waking up to failure and

4027
02:12:35,179 --> 02:12:36,848
then at the end of a whole bunch

4028
02:12:36,848 --> 02:12:37,849
of failures is something that's

4029
02:12:37,849 --> 02:12:39,050
great.

4030
02:12:40,051 --> 02:12:41,719
Tessa didn't really think I

4031
02:12:41,719 --> 02:12:43,154
want to make an app.

4032
02:12:43,154 --> 02:12:44,856
Tessa found a problem, a food

4033
02:12:44,856 --> 02:12:46,391
waste which you could use the

4034
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,059
app to help to solve.

4035
02:12:48,059 --> 02:12:49,927
Emma's grandma was diagnosed

4036
02:12:49,927 --> 02:12:51,095

4037
02:12:51,095 --> 02:12:52,430
She even forgot my daughter's

4038
02:12:52,430 --> 02:12:53,564
birthday.

4039
02:12:53,564 --> 02:12:55,299
So Emma tried to search for an

4040
02:12:55,299 --> 02:12:56,067
app that would help,

4041
02:12:56,067 --> 02:12:57,068
but she couldn't find it.

4042
02:12:57,068 --> 02:13:00,104
So she said, you know, why don't

4043
02:13:00,104 --> 02:13:01,005
we just do it ourselves.

4044
02:13:01,005 --> 02:13:03,541
My husband was a diabetic.

4045
02:13:03,541 --> 02:13:07,045
That inspired Jeffrey to do

4046
02:13:07,045 --> 02:13:09,514
something about diabetes, and

4047
02:13:09,514 --> 02:13:11,816
it's an answer to a lot of

4048
02:13:11,816 --> 02:13:14,085
people's prayers.

I couldn't believe that he made

4052
02:13:19,323 --> 02:13:20,158
it.

4053
02:13:20,158 --> 02:13:21,459
I mean to me it was remarkable.

4054
02:13:21,459 --> 02:13:22,427
She pulled out her cell

4055
02:13:22,427 --> 02:13:24,429
phone, and I saw his app on her

4056
02:13:24,429 --> 02:13:25,363
phone, and I was like trying not

4057
02:13:25,363 --> 02:13:27,498
to freak out, but oh my gosh.

4058
02:13:27,498 --> 02:13:29,033
For my wife, it's not just

4059
02:13:29,033 --> 02:13:31,002
creating, it's really wanting to

4060
02:13:31,002 --> 02:13:33,104
be a part of something big.

4061
02:13:33,104 --> 02:13:34,238
The one lesson that I learned

4062
02:13:34,238 --> 02:13:35,440
from Jeremy every day is just

4063
02:13:35,440 --> 02:13:37,775
that determination, tenacity, to

4064
02:13:37,775 --> 02:13:38,609
focus.

4065
02:13:38,609 --> 02:13:40,478
He foresaw the impact that the

4066
02:13:40,478 --> 02:13:42,580
iPhone was going to have, and he

4067
02:13:42,580 --> 02:13:43,681
bet everything on getting an app

4068
02:13:43,681 --> 02:13:44,515
for it,

4069
02:13:44,515 --> 02:13:45,483
and I think that it was one of

4070
02:13:45,483 --> 02:13:47,718
the most important things that

4071
02:13:47,718 --> 02:13:48,486
Yelp did.

4072
02:13:48,486 --> 02:13:50,855
I think he's made a big

4073
02:13:50,855 --> 02:13:52,323
difference, and so do thousands

4074

4076
02:13:55,226 --> 02:13:58,396
also teach others and it makes
