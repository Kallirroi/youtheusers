1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,529
now this is why we getso excited when 

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:07,730
we're working  on a new version of iOS 

3
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,679
because we know that we can positively 

4
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,969
affect millions of developers and 

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:18,390
hundreds of millions of users and that 

6
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:23,970
isexactly what we've been up  to the 

7
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,400
team at Apple has beenworking 

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,359
incredibly hard  on the latest version of 

9
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,460
iOS and today it's a great thrill that I 

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:39,890
announce  iOS 7 

11
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,309
iOS 7 is the biggest change to iOS since 

12
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:53,190
the introduction of iPhone it's packed 

13
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,879
with amazing new features and a stunning 

14
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,739
new user interface we prepared a video 

15
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,329
to show you our thinking behind the

16
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:05,519
design and I'd like to run  it for you 

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,700
now

18
00:01:18,730 --> 00:01:21,760
we have always thoughtof  design as 

19
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,160
being so much more than just the way 

20
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:32,090
something looks it's the whole thing the 

21
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:34,100
way something actually works on so many 

22
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,820
different levels 

23
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,960
ultimately of course design defines so 

24
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,830
much of our experience

25
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:00,430
I think there is a profound and enduring 

26
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:06,280
beauty in simplicity in clarity in 

27
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:10,669
efficiency true simplicity is derived 

28
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:14,540
from so much more than justthe absence 

29
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:17,090
of clutterand  ornamentation it's about 

30
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:21,340
bringing order to complexity

31
00:02:24,459 --> 00:02:29,090
iOS 7 is a clear representation of these 

32
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:36,650
goals it has a whole new structure that 

33
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:40,519
is coherentand it is applied across the 

34
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,209
entire system

35
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,720
we'veconsidered  the tiniest details 

36
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,560
like refining the typographyto much 

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,620
largerones  by redesigning all the icons 

38
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,100
and developing a grid system allowed us 

39
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,310
toachieve a much more harmonious 

40
00:03:07,310 --> 00:03:10,310
relationship between individual elements

41
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,500
we've also incorporated a whole new 

42
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,460
palette of colors 

43
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,550
distinct functional layers help 

44
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:30,500
establish hierarchy and order and the 

45
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:34,070
use of translucency gives you a  sense of 

46
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:41,150
your context these plains  combined with 

47
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:43,870
new approaches to animation and motion

48
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,670
create a sense of depth and vitality 

49
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:59,450
the iPhone responding to your movements 

50
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:02,270
drives the parallax to create a whole 

51
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:09,980
new experience of depth in many ways 

52
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,920
we've tried to create an interface that 

53
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,560
is unobtrusive and deferential one where 

54
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,959
the design recedes and in doing so 

55
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,910
actually elevates your content even the 

56
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:28,600
simple actof changing your wallpaper 

57
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,210
has a very noticeable effect on the way 

58
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,480
your iPhone looks and feels across the 

59
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:38,170
entire system

60
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,430
while ios7 is completely new it was 

61
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:47,040
importantto us to make  it instantly 

62
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,610
familiar 

63
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,130
we wantedto  take an experience that 

64
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,430
people know very well  and actually add 

65
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:01,850
to it to  make it more useful  to make it 

66
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,330
moreenjoyable 

67
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,170
to createit we brought together a broad 

68
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:11,260
range of expertise from design to

69
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:15,310
engineering  with what we've been able to 

70
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,470
achieve togetherwe see  ios7 as defining 

71
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,470
an important new direction and in many 

72
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,760
ways  the beginning 

73
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:07,210
you are going to absolutelylove ios7 

74
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,110

00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,850
major effortis only possible  because of 

76
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,280
the incredible collaboration between 

77
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,450
Johnny and his amazing design team and 

78
00:06:22,450 --> 00:06:25,730
Craig and his incredible engineering 

79
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,470
team without further ado I'd like to 

80
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,850
invite Craig back up to take you through 

81
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:38,900
iOS 7the biggest change to iOS since 

82
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,530
the iPhone 

83
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,169
well on behalf of all of the engineers 

84
00:06:54,169 --> 00:06:57,560
and designers who worked so hard to make 

85
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,409
today a realityI'm absolutely thrilled 

86
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:02,240
to have this opportunity to show you 

87
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,800
iOS 7 let's take a look it's 

88
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,500
unbelievable it's just gorgeous 

89
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,940
from thetypography on this lock screen 

90
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:15,889
to the vitality of the background of an 

91
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,550
animation to the home screen with these 

92
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,180
icons looks so great it just looked 

93
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,340
fantastic 

94
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,400
and you know a lot of us have our own 

95
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,270
wallpaper you know we like pictures of 

96
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,229
our family there and now that liveliness 

97
00:07:32,229 --> 00:07:35,599
actually carries through to the  home 

98
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,310
screen because as you move the device in 

99
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:39,800
your hand it actually tracks your motion 

100
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,919
and as parallax thix but you can see 

101
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:45,169
behind the icons it's really incredible 

102
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:48,080
and it carries over across the  system 

103
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,610
this liveliness let me just take a look

104
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,639
at somethinglike  weather where the 

105
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,590
motion conveys this information and 

106
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,840
where the edge to edge design just takes 

107
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,300
advantageof every pixel on that Retina 

108
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:03,349
display it's so nice it's great for apps 

109
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:08,840
youuse  every day like messages your 

110
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,090
calendar your email is gorgeous your 

111
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:19,779
friends never look more attractive and 

112
00:08:19,779 --> 00:08:22,219
GameCenter  we just completely ran out of 

113
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:24,879
green felt

114
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,470
and would as well this has got to be 

115
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,110
good for the environment

116
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,870
the clocks look great and even apps like 

117
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:41,659
stocksand compass  they just have this 

118
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,400
look of precision thesense of purpose 

119
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,790
the best way to appreciate  iOS 7 is to 

120
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:48,950
see it live I'd like to give you a demo

00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:07,070
in my handjust slide out the lock 

125
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,510

gesture now from the left edge of the 

160
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,700
device it's great for using  the device 

161
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:01,340
of one hand if I want to just go  back I 

162
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,390

unlock your device so that's a quick 

195
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:43,850
look at iOS 7 it's a comprehensive 

196
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,970
end-to-end redesign of the user 

197
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,240
experience installing iOS 7 on your 

198
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,610
phone is like getting an entirely new 

199
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,710
phone but when you already know how to 

200
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,350
use one that's so much more beautiful 

201
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,820
and functional than ever before but iOS 

202
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,030
7 is actually more than that it's also a 

203
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:08,360
major feature release as well I have  10 

204
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,710
features I want to talk to you about

205
00:13:09,710 --> 00:13:13,900
today starting with control center 

206
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:16,460
control center is something that's so 

207
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:19,340
simple and yet so essential you have 

208
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,810
those switches that you just want to get 

209
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,400
to really  quickly from wherever you are 

210
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,190
well now with control center swipe up 

211
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,360
from thebottom of  the device 

212
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,959
and there they are

213
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:36,110
turn onairplane mode  adjust your 

214
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:38,990
brightness play a songeven  get a 

215
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:43,430
flashlightand  available from anywhere 

216
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,800
including your lock screen so if you 

217
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,000
wake upin the  middle of the night you 

218
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,250
need to find something your flashlights 

219
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,980
right there and that's control center 

220
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:56,660
next let's talk about multitasking now 

221
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,019
iOS 7 has always been built on the 

222
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:03,259
industrial strength foundations of OS 10 

223
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,829
and had intrinsic  powerful multitasking 

224
00:14:06,829 --> 00:14:08,779
capabilities but we had to be careful 

225
00:14:08,779 --> 00:14:10,160
about  how we've exposed these two 

226
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,990
applications because we want to preserve 

227
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,459
great battery life now in iOS 4 we did 

228
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,649
add support for select kinds of

229
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,660
applications to do multitasking things 

230
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,850
likeplaying music in the background or 

231
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,519
receiving a voice over IP call while 

232
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,170
your app was in the background

233
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,259
well now in iOS 7 I'm pleased to 

234
00:14:30,259 --> 00:14:31,069
announcethat we're going  to have 

235
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:36,610
multitasking for all apps with great 

236
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:45,410
so how does itwork well imagine  you 

237
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,510
have an app thatyou're using  constantly 

238
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,040
throughout the day a social networking 

239
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,110
app or somethingyou're checking  in all 

240
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,600
the time well iOS 7  is notices that 

241
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,160
pattern of use and is going to  provide 

242
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,410
that app with frequent background 

243
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,690
activity to stay up to date let's see if 

244
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,760
another app you usemay be that you  just 

245
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,860
check-in on in the morning breakfast 

246
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,380
maybe at night after  work well iOS  7 

247
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,700
notices thattoo and it's going  to give 

248
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:10,760
that app background cycles just in time 

249
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,670
so it's up to date for when you need it 

250
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,860
now in addition  to this intelligent 

251
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,160
scheduling iOS 7 does opportunistic

252
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,170
updates the average user wakes their 

253
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,210
device dozens of times a day and  those 

254
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,920
provide great opportunitieswhen the 

255
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,170
system's already  powered up to update 

256
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,600
apps in thebackground  it also adapts 

257
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,030
intelligentlyto network conditions  so 

258
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:34,430
if it's a good coverage it's a great 

259
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:37,910
time tofetch and it coalesces updates 

260
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:39,800
across multiple applications so once you 

261
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,200
have those radios power it up lets 

262
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,940
multiple applications take advantage of 

263
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,320
itfor their background updates  and 

264
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,170
finally iOS 7 responds to push

265
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,780
notifications as a trigger to give that 

266
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,640
application time in the backgroundso 

267
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,080
when you follow that notification the 

268
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:57,400
Apple are to be up to date 

269
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:04,220
now Iowaseven  also has a great new user 

270
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,260
interfacefor moving  between all the 

271
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,550
things you have going on on your phone 

272
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,329
now you can double click and  move into 

273
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:12,860
Notification Center and just swipe 

274
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,810
between your running applications tap 

275
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:17,510
andmove right  in and that is 

276
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,010
multitasking in iOS 7 

277
00:16:24,939 --> 00:16:28,910
next let's talk aboutSafari Safari is 

278
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:31,939
the most popular mobile browser in the

279
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:34,790
worldand an iOS  7 we're making it even 

280
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:39,639

283
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,899
smart search field from that search

284
00:16:47,899 --> 00:16:51,290

and integration with the same iCloud 

290
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,270
keychain you saw earlier with Mavericks 

291
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,000
I'd like to give you a demo of  Safari 

292
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:22,789
now let's take a look okay let's head on 

293
00:17:22,789 --> 00:17:27,289
into Safari  so here we are in Safari 

294
00:17:27,289 --> 00:17:29,899
I'm gonna just zoom in on this page one 

295
00:17:29,899 --> 00:17:33,470

00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,980
same gesture you saw earlier for going 

303
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,630

304
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,250

367
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:57,960
multitasking in iOS 7 thank you 

368
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,650
so of course there's there's much much

369
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:10,930
more the iOS  7 including airdrop airdrop 

370
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:13,930
is absolutely theeasiest way to  share 

371
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,220
with the people that are right around 

372
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,490
you so now when you're in any app that 

373
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,010
supports a share sheet  you bring up the 

374
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,930
share sheet and your friends that are

375
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:25,590
all around you just show up right there 

376
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:28,990
you tap onone and they're going  to get 

377
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:32,320
a panel right on their display and they 

378
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,300
can accept what it is that you shared

379
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,790
they accept it they're taken right into 

380
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,650
the app and you know if you want to 

381
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:41,170
share with multiple people you just tap 

382
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,170
tap tapno need  to wander around the 

383
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,640
room bumping your phone 

384
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,509
now this is system-wide for any app that

385
00:21:57,509 --> 00:21:59,730
supports a share sheet and of course  it 

386
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,309
uses peer-to-peer Wi-Fi for maximum 

387
00:22:02,309 --> 00:22:04,499
speedand all your transmissions are 

388
00:22:04,499 --> 00:22:07,200
securely encrypted becauseit uses  the 

389
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,480
latest Wi-Fihardware  it's supported on 

390
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,409
the iPhone 5 the fourth-generation iPad 

391
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:15,450
iPad Mini and the fifth-generation iPod 

392
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:20,009
touch and  that is airdrop next let's 

393
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:23,610
talk about the camera  so now your camera 

394
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,159
and iOS 7 is 4 cameras in one you can 

395
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:28,440
just swipe  from your video camera to 

396
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,649
your photo camera to your square cropped 

397
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:34,740
camera to yourpano camera  and when 

398
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,779
you're taking stills you now have access 

399
00:22:36,779 --> 00:22:40,470
tolive photo filters from some gorgeous 

400
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,869
black and whites  to some classic  color 

401
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,299
filters aswell 

402
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,619
so with your great new camera we want to

403
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:48,570
give you a great new way to manage your 

404
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,629
photos and it's the new Photos app you 

405
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:54,210
know for many usersthis is what their 

406
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,090
photo organization looks like an endless 

407
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:59,730
unorganized stream of their camera roll 

408
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:01,350
we've all been there but youknow it 

409
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:04,649
doesn't haveto be this way there's 

410
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:07,230
greatinformation in those  photos iOS 

411
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,240
knows where you took the photos and when 

412
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,279
you took them and that provides inherent 

413
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,200
structure that we can use to organize 

414
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,619
those photos and now in photos in iOS 7 

415
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:20,129
we do we organize them into moments I'd 

416
00:23:20,129 --> 00:23:21,809
like to give you a demo of that right 

417
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:23,840
now

418
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,700
so let's take a look now at  the Photos 

419
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,690
app so here you see some photos that 

420
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,450
weretaken in San Francisco and you see 

421
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,700
nothing was done to organize these 

422
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,170
photos explicitly and yet they have

423
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,520
these labels like the Palace of Fine 

424
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:46,660
Arts Baker Beach Lombard Street it 

425
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,580
provides this natural organization for 

426
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,710
appreciating the photos we can go up 

427
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,420
there more trips at more time in San 

428
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,400
Francisco Golden Gate San Francisco 

429
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,710
Fisherman's Wharf but then you see we 

430
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,450
have home we have  photos taken at home 

431
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:00,430
and photos taken at the elementary 

432
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,580
schooland  around that area and now if 

433
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,490
you want to zoomback  out to get a more 

434
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:07,930
of a bird's-eye view  of your collection 

435
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:10,150
we draw these moments intelligently

436
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:13,180
together into collections so see here

437
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,160
how that multiple day trip around San 

438
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,440
Francisco is collected sorry about that 

439
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,530
got a little excited there into it's a 

440
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,770
very exciting interface into a multi-day

441
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:26,290
trip in San Francisco andthat time at 

442
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:28,000
home andaround  the school well that's 

443
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,730
one moment that's one collection as well 

444
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,620
it's a really great way to browse your 

445
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,980
photos you can even go all the way out 

446
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,520
to theyear level look across  your whole 

447
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,540
photo collection

448
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,100
and look at how we pull out the 

449
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,169
interesting places that you went in that 

450
00:24:51,169 --> 00:24:54,610
year like 2011 was  Colorado and Hawaii 

451
00:24:54,610 --> 00:24:57,529
2012 went to South America  you may not 

452
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,360
remember when you did itbut iOS does 

453
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,570
that's right there and you know with 

454
00:25:02,570 --> 00:25:05,090
this Retina displayyou  can even kind of 

455
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:06,740
make outpatterns of photos and when 

456
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,149
different occasions are and of course we

457
00:25:08,149 --> 00:25:09,289
found like we had the urge that we 

458
00:25:09,289 --> 00:25:11,059
wanted to just tap in right  from here 

459
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:14,419
and so now in fact you can you canjust 

460
00:25:14,419 --> 00:25:17,450
tap and scrub and find the photo you're 

461
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:19,639
looking for just like that it's really

462
00:25:19,639 --> 00:25:22,370
just amazing  so I can just pick a photo 

463
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:24,559
here whichever one I want it's kind of 

464
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,990
cute and now we can edit it because we 

465
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,549
have photofilters so I can go into the 

466
00:25:28,549 --> 00:25:31,850
filtershere  I can try different color 

467
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:34,909
effects and if I find one I like maybe a 

468
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,950
nice blackand white can do  it just like 

469
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:37,460
that 

470
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,429
I'll ply it save that photo away we also 

471
00:25:40,429 --> 00:25:42,230
have great new waysto share your  photos 

472
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,730
in the photos apps let's bring up

474
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,769
any of you were runningiOS 7 I'd see 

475
00:25:48,769 --> 00:25:50,059
you it looks like it didn't leak so 

476
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:51,649
that's good you're not in there right 

477
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:53,840

505
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,660

iOS 7 

510
00:27:18,889 --> 00:27:21,779
so integration with Internet services is 

511
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,019
a huge part of the experienceof iOS  and 

512
00:27:25,019 --> 00:27:28,710
never more so than an iOS 7 so to  take 

513
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,330

00:27:51,149 --> 00:27:53,909
bottom  and you get the results in a 

521
00:27:53,909 --> 00:27:57,299
beautiful gorgeous clean way but Siri 

522
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,729

535
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:34,169
so you could say play my lastvoice mail 

536
00:28:34,169 --> 00:28:38,399
or turn on Bluetooth or increase my 

537
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,700
brightness

538
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,310
and it can answer a lot more questions 

539
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,630
because we've integrated some new 

540
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,990

541
00:28:53,990 --> 00:28:55,220
what people are saying or what's 

542
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,100
happening we've integrated the world's 

543
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,680
largestencyclopedia  in Wikipedia and 

544
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:04,430
we've even integrated web search results 

545
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:07,850
fromBing  right inside of Siri and it's 

546
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:11,810
great forphotos  too and that's some of 

547
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:15,860
the new features of Siri in iOS 7 now 

548
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,140

musicplayback and control  from an iOS 

552
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,500

553
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,580

554
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:44,180

00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:51,249
today we're introducing an amazing way 

608
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:53,970
to discover new music and we call it 

609
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:57,239
iTunes  radio 

610
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,010
and here's what it looks like it's built

611
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:07,260
right into the music app but rather than

612
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,120
tell you about it I'd love to show it  to 

613
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:19,370
you and we'll launch the music app and 

614
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,570
the first thing you'll notice is we've 

615
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:23,460
got a setof featured stations that our 

616
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,290
programming team have createdso you can 

617
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:27,210
see the songs that are trending on 

618
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:29,820
Twitter rightnow  or even the songs that 

619
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,290
you guys are all going to hear this week 

620
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:38,669
at WWDC but I feel like summer songs so 

621
00:33:38,669 --> 00:33:54,480
you just tap and once you have a station 

622
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,299
you love you can just tap the I and you 

623
00:33:57,299 --> 00:33:58,740
could share  it with a friend or even 

624
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,419
create a new station  based on this 

625
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,830
artist or song I can easily skip to the 

626
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,669
sea what's the  next song 

627
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,079
I'll go back to stations but it's not 

628
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:20,549
just the featured stations that we 

629
00:34:20,549 --> 00:34:22,109
provideyou can create  your own stations 

630
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:23,219
here are some  that I've previously 

631
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:27,359
created but I feel like doing something 

632
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:31,319
new now  our music team is providing you 

633
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,969
with hundreds of stations based on 

634
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:37,168
alternative country classic rock but I 

635
00:34:37,168 --> 00:34:38,339
feel like doing something a little more 

636
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:48,289
specific how about some Led Zeppelin 

637
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,190
so it starts off witha great Led 

638
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,490
Zeppelinsong let's go ahead  and see 

639
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:16,130
what else is on this station and a great 

640
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,900
thing is I can always modify the station 

641
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,760
I can just tap the star and I can say 

642
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,339
play more songs like this or never play 

643
00:35:22,339 --> 00:35:24,800
this song or add it to my wish  list now 

644
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,150
I like this so let's play some more

645
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:29,930

646
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,670
feature of iTunes radio is it keeps

669
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,380
to iOS 7 than we had time  to talk to you 

670
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,700

671
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,060

notification sync so if you dismiss a 

675
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,810
notification on one device you don't 

676
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,100
have to deal with it over and over  again 

677
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:29,660
on your other devices great feature for 

678
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,790
our users in China with integration of 

679
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,860
the popular microblogging website site

00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:37,220
Tencent Weibo and for those of you who

00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:50,390
VPNnow there's yeah a couple enterprise 

685
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,030
people in the audience alright so in 

686
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:54,380
addition to all this there's one feature 

687
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,550
I want to talk about in a little bit 

688
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:59,590
more detail which is activation  lock so 

689
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:02,870
hundreds of millions of us use Find My 

690
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:05,570
iPhone to find our phone when it's just 

691
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,460
lost inthe couch or maybe left at 

692
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,890
Starbucksbut also when it's been stolen 

693
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,150
and now with  activation lock if a thief 

694
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,990
tries to turn off Find My iPhoneor if 

695
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,810
theyeven wipe the device  entirely they 

696
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:23,030
will not be able to reactivate it 

697
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:25,310
because they don't know your iCloud 

698
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:27,820
username

699
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:37,470

700
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:39,750
powerful  theft deterrent now of course 

701
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,000
