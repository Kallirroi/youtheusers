00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:24,310
And of course, new
and improved apps.

177
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,847
Just since its release in
October we've installed

178
00:09:27,847 --> 00:09:31,584
over 40 million copies
of Mavericks.

179
00:09:31,584 --> 00:09:37,257
This is the most of a single
release ever in Apple's history.

180
00:09:37,257 --> 00:09:44,898
Also, that makes over 50 percent
of our installed base working

181
00:09:44,898 --> 00:09:48,401
on our latest operating system.

182
00:09:48,401 --> 00:09:51,604
This is the fastest
adoption ever

183
00:09:51,604 --> 00:09:56,443
of any PC operating
system in history.

184
00:09:56,443 --> 00:10:01,047
Now, you may wonder how
that compares to Windows.

185
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,449
[ Laughter ]

186
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:06,052
I knew somebody was going to ask
so I decided to make a chart.

187
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,520
[ Laughter ]

188
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:11,191
Well, as it turns
out Windows 8 shipped

189
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:16,362
about a year before Mavericks
and it's at 14 percent.

190
00:10:17,564 --> 00:10:20,433
[ Laughter ]

191
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:22,569
Need I say more?

192
00:10:22,569 --> 00:10:29,142
[ Applause ]

193
00:10:29,142 --> 00:10:33,780
So, we could not be happier
with Mavericks and the momentum

194
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:38,451
of the Mac, but of course
we're always future focused.

195
00:10:38,451 --> 00:10:41,955
And today, to talk about
the future of OS X,

196
00:10:41,955 --> 00:10:45,191
I'd like to invite my
colleague up, Craig Federighi,

197
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,359
to tell us all about it.

198
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:47,594
Craig.

00:10:52,599 --> 00:10:53,633
Good morning.

201
00:10:53,633 --> 00:10:56,603
Wow.

[ Applause ]

203
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:05,612
Well, it's wonderful to be here
presenting among the greatest

204
00:11:05,612 --> 00:11:08,047
developers collected
in the world.

205
00:11:08,047 --> 00:11:09,716
You guys are fantastic.

206
00:11:09,716 --> 00:11:13,219
You know, it was just a
year ago, here at WWDC,

207
00:11:13,219 --> 00:11:19,058
when we narrowly averted a
major OS X naming crisis.

208
00:11:19,058 --> 00:11:20,794
[ Laughter ]

209
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:25,098
You may remember that we're able
to deftly shift from names based

210
00:11:25,098 --> 00:11:30,303
on big cats to names based on
beautiful places in California,

211
00:11:30,303 --> 00:11:33,907
starting of course
with OS X Mavericks.

212
00:11:33,907 --> 00:11:37,844
Well, it's another year
and time for another name

213
00:11:37,844 --> 00:11:42,615
and so we collected our
crack product marketing team,

214
00:11:42,615 --> 00:11:47,520
shoved them in their VW Minibus
and set them out on the road.

215
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:52,091
Now, they first ventured south
discovering OS X, Oxnard.

216
00:11:52,091 --> 00:11:54,027
[ Laughter ]

217
00:11:54,027 --> 00:11:55,695
This wasn't quite right.

218
00:11:55,695 --> 00:11:59,065
But undeterred, they
headed east,

219
00:11:59,065 --> 00:12:02,335
landed in OS X Rancho Cucamonga.

220
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:04,604
[ Laughter ]

221
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:07,040
Still, we hadn't
quite hit the mark.

222
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:14,047
So, they boldly ventured
north landing at OS X Weed.

224
00:12:15,315 --> 00:12:16,549

[ Applause ]

226
00:12:21,788 --> 00:12:24,424
Strangely, this one had
large pockets of support

227
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:26,259
within the product
marketing organization,

228
00:12:26,259 --> 00:12:30,997
but saner heads did
prevail and they set off

229
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:34,601
on what then was somewhat
more circuitous path.

230
00:12:34,601 --> 00:12:36,369
It took them ultimately
to a place

231
00:12:36,369 --> 00:12:40,406
that embodies the
beauty and power of OS X.

232
00:12:40,406 --> 00:12:44,577
We discovered OS X Yosemite.

233
00:12:44,577 --> 00:12:53,653
[ Applause ]

234
00:12:55,054 --> 00:13:00,360
Now, Yosemite is a fantastic new
release with a new interface,

235
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,529
big enhancements to
our most popular apps

236
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:07,433
and something all knew,
we call Continuity.

237
00:13:07,433 --> 00:13:10,436
Now, I want to start
with design.

238
00:13:10,436 --> 00:13:15,708
OS X, of course started with
the bold design of Aqua.

239
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,444
And over the years, it's evolved

240
00:13:18,444 --> 00:13:23,182
to the refined look we all
loved today in Mavericks.

241
00:13:23,182 --> 00:13:27,287
Well, with Yosemite, we
continue this evolution and I'd

242
00:13:27,287 --> 00:13:32,558
like to give you a look
at where we're headed.

243
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:41,634
[ Music ]

244
00:14:28,481 --> 00:14:30,550
How about that?

245
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:36,656
[ Applause ]

246
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:39,592
I think the team has done
some remarkable work.

247
00:14:39,592 --> 00:14:43,262
You know, we started with the
most fundamental controls,

248
00:14:43,262 --> 00:14:48,668
focused always on clarity,
as well as utility.

249
00:14:48,668 --> 00:14:53,272
We refined the tool bars
and the window materials

250
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:55,274
and the window constructions.

251
00:14:55,274 --> 00:14:57,944
If you look at the window title
bar, you'll see how the use

252
00:14:57,944 --> 00:15:00,346
of translucent materials
gives you a sense of place

253
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:02,682
as you scroll your content.

254
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:05,852
Now, these same carefully
crafted translucent materials

255
00:15:05,852 --> 00:15:07,720
are used in the sidebars.

256
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,759
So now, your windows take on
the personality of your desktop.

257
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,262
As you change your desktop
picture, your window adapts

258
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:19,432
to reflect that personality
and that temperature.

259
00:15:19,432 --> 00:15:23,369
And the translucency also
helps maintain a sense of depth

260
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:28,274
and place as you move your
windows over one another.

261
00:15:28,274 --> 00:15:31,844
Now, we also use the same
gorgeous translucent material

262
00:15:31,844 --> 00:15:37,083
for the dock and check out these
beautifully crafted new icons.

263
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:40,353
So clean and yet so
fundamentally still Mac.

264
00:15:40,353 --> 00:15:45,124
And check out the trash can,
that is a gorgeous trash can.

265
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,293
You wouldn't believe how
much time we spent crafting a

266
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,061
trash can.

267
00:15:48,061 --> 00:15:49,128
[ Laughter ]

268
00:15:49,128 --> 00:15:52,265
So, we also focused on precise

269
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:54,400
and consistent typography
throughout.

270
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,803
So, from the menus
to the window chrome

271
00:15:56,803 --> 00:16:00,940
to application control is
consistent and clear type.

272
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:04,777
Now, we know, for our pro users,
often, they really want to focus

273
00:16:04,777 --> 00:16:06,979
on the center on the
screen and not be distracted

274
00:16:06,979 --> 00:16:09,315
by bright menus and
bright docks,

275
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:13,519
so we also introduced
a dark mode.

Lovers of dark.

278
00:16:19,559 --> 00:16:23,062
Yes. So, of course
these changes extend

279
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:24,730
through to the applications.

280
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,167
You notice here, with
Calendar, this construction

281
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:30,269
with a common toolbar
and title bar area

282
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:33,706
that makes the window both
more distinctly recognizable,

283
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:37,243
but more importantly maximizes
the space available for content.

284
00:16:37,243 --> 00:16:38,411
And we carry this

285
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:41,881
over throughout the
system to apps like Maps.

286
00:16:41,881 --> 00:16:45,485
Now, we also have a new look
for sidebar apps, like Messages,

287
00:16:45,485 --> 00:16:47,887
you can see it here with the
beautiful translucent material

288
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:49,889
running top to bottom.

289
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:53,192
And we extend that look
to apps like FaceTime,

290
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:55,995
Contacts, and Reminders.

291
00:16:55,995 --> 00:16:59,198
All in all they come
together for a gorgeous

292
00:16:59,198 --> 00:17:04,503

of OS X, the best ever.

00:17:10,877 --> 00:17:13,713
Next, let's talk about
Notification Center.

295
00:17:13,713 --> 00:17:16,883
Notification Center
on OS X, of course,

296
00:17:16,883 --> 00:17:20,051

material

It also now, most importantly,
has a new Today view.

299
00:17:26,626 --> 00:17:30,363
So, you get an at-a-glance
look at your Calendar,

300
00:17:30,363 --> 00:17:35,535
your Reminders, Weather, and
more, but most importantly,

301
00:17:35,535 --> 00:17:39,238
you can extend the contents of
Today view with the contents

302
00:17:39,238 --> 00:17:42,875
of widgets and apps that you've
downloaded from the App Store.

303
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:46,612
Just add them right in and set
up the Today view, that you want

304
00:17:46,612 --> 00:17:50,149
for at-a-glance access
to information.

305
00:17:50,149 --> 00:17:53,553

Next up. Spotlight.

308
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:02,428
So Spotlight has always
been a superfast way

309
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:06,465
to launch applications and
find content local on your Mac.

310
00:18:06,465 --> 00:18:08,801
And Yosemite is a
great new interface.

311
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,204
So when you click on
the magnifying glass

312
00:18:11,204 --> 00:18:12,872
on the toolbar you'll
get a big field right

313
00:18:12,872 --> 00:18:14,006
in the middle of the display.

314
00:18:14,006 --> 00:18:16,776
And if you just type
a few characters,

315
00:18:16,776 --> 00:18:20,146
you can launch an app just
like that, or type the name

316
00:18:20,146 --> 00:18:22,815
of a document and you
get great search results

317
00:18:22,815 --> 00:18:25,918
and an inline preview,
it's really awesome.

318
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,888
Now, in addition to these
sources, local to your Mac,

319
00:18:28,888 --> 00:18:32,458
we also tap into sources of
information on the internet.

320
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:35,795
So for instance, type a few
characters in like Yosemite,

321
00:18:35,795 --> 00:18:39,165
you can get news feed,
information from Wikipedia,

322
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:42,268
and even maps all
at your finger tips.

323
00:18:42,268 --> 00:18:44,036
I'd like to give
you a quick demo

324
00:18:44,036 --> 00:18:47,540
of the new UI in Yosemite now.

326
00:18:52,378 --> 00:18:53,479
All right.

327
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,481
So here is our first
look at Yosemite live.

328
00:18:55,481 --> 00:18:58,818
So we see our beautiful new
typography in our menus,

329
00:18:58,818 --> 00:19:02,588
this gorgeous new dock
and these beautiful icons.

330
00:19:02,588 --> 00:19:03,956
Let's launch an app.

331
00:19:03,956 --> 00:19:06,292
I'm going to start here with
Maps and I want you to observe

332
00:19:06,292 --> 00:19:08,928
that as I scroll the
content of the map,

333
00:19:08,928 --> 00:19:12,565
the way that the title bar
actually reacts its translucency

334
00:19:12,565 --> 00:19:17,036
and color to the content
beneath is just really gorgeous.

335
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:19,605
I'm going to launch
now another app.

336
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:23,376
Calendar. So Calendar has
a new look for a week view

337
00:19:23,376 --> 00:19:25,645
but also an all new day view.

338
00:19:25,645 --> 00:19:28,247
And you notice here on day
view, I have all of my meetings

339
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,750
in the day right
here on the left,

340
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,952
and on the right I got
details about my appointments.

341
00:19:32,952 --> 00:19:34,720
So for instance,
here at 2 o'clock,

342
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,656
we have our executive
karaoke outing,

343
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:39,759
that's going to be big blast.

344
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,127
It's right there.

345
00:19:41,127 --> 00:19:43,162
You want to probably drop in
on that if you get the chance.

346
00:19:43,162 --> 00:19:46,432
So let's take a look
now at Messages.

347
00:19:46,432 --> 00:19:47,900
So Messages, you see this use

348
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:51,270
of the translucent sidebar
material, how it reacts subtly

349
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,440
to the background is really
nice, and how the contents

350
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:59,178
of the title bar react as I
scroll content underneath.

351
00:19:59,178 --> 00:20:00,313
It's really cool.

352
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:03,149
Let's take a look at
Notification Center.

353
00:20:03,149 --> 00:20:05,418
So of course, I have
my notifications here,

354
00:20:05,418 --> 00:20:08,688
but I also have Today view
so I can see my Calendar

355
00:20:08,688 --> 00:20:10,256
at a glance, my Weather.

356
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,626
These are interactive so I
can click, get hourly weather,

357
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:16,996
clock, interact with stocks for
instance, or even Reminders.

358
00:20:16,996 --> 00:20:19,398
So here I'm supposed to practice
for the demo and I forgot to do

359
00:20:19,398 --> 00:20:20,966
that but it's too late now.

360
00:20:20,966 --> 00:20:22,835
So, we'll send out
one on its way.

361
00:20:22,835 --> 00:20:26,005
Now, of course, I can edit
these widgets as well,

362
00:20:26,005 --> 00:20:27,506
just click the Edit
button down here

363
00:20:27,506 --> 00:20:30,009
and you see widgets available
to me right here on the side.

364
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:32,712
These are all from apps
that can export widgets.

365
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:34,747
So I'm just going to
drag out Calculator,

366
00:20:34,747 --> 00:20:38,417
add that in here just like that
or even a third party widget.

367
00:20:38,417 --> 00:20:41,053
Let's drag one of those
in, ESPN SportsCenter.

368
00:20:41,053 --> 00:20:45,524
So right there, I get all my
information right at a glance.

369
00:20:45,524 --> 00:20:47,593
It's really awesome.

371
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:54,266
So next. Spotlight.

372
00:20:54,266 --> 00:20:57,036
So I'm going to click here on
the magnifying glass and, boom,

373
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:59,271
got a search field right in
the middle of the screen.

374
00:20:59,271 --> 00:21:01,574
I can type just a couple of
characters to launch an app

375
00:21:01,574 --> 00:21:03,175
like our new reminders.

376
00:21:03,175 --> 00:21:03,843
There it is.

377
00:21:03,843 --> 00:21:05,211
It's that easy.

378
00:21:05,211 --> 00:21:07,546
But of course, Spotlight is
great for looking up people too.

379
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:09,815
So I'm going to look
up Phil Schiller here.

380
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:11,150
There's Phil.

381
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,786
And you see I have all of
his contact information here,

382
00:21:13,786 --> 00:21:16,288
but I also have matches
on mail from Phil.

383
00:21:16,288 --> 00:21:18,391
Phil and I are planning
a camping trip.

384
00:21:18,391 --> 00:21:20,092
He's a bit of a gear nut
and has something he wants

385
00:21:20,092 --> 00:21:21,660
to try out on our trip.

386
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,996
We also have Events
and Reminders.

387
00:21:23,996 --> 00:21:28,000
So we have here that our Meeting
at the Campsite and-- oh, good.

388
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,804
I see that Jeff and Johnny are
both in on the trip as well.

389
00:21:31,804 --> 00:21:35,307
And I'll tell you, you just have
not had chili by the campfire

390
00:21:35,307 --> 00:21:36,442
until you've eaten it with one

391
00:21:36,442 --> 00:21:38,077
of Johnny's custom
crafted aluminium spoons.

It's a-- it's the diamond

that really make the experience.

395
00:21:46,352 --> 00:21:50,790
So, I'm working on a document
as well to help plan our trip.

396
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,691
Now, there are a lot of ways
of course to find documents,

397
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:54,293
but one way now is by app.

398
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:56,128
So this is a numbers document.

399
00:21:56,128 --> 00:21:58,464
I typed numbers and you
see in addition to the app,

400
00:21:58,464 --> 00:22:02,034
I get all my recent documents
that I've opened with that app

401
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:03,135
and I can access
them right here.

402
00:22:03,135 --> 00:22:04,970
So let's open up my hiking trip.

403
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:10,676
And here we see that the trip
has planned involved a 16.4 mile

404
00:22:10,676 --> 00:22:14,680
hike and you're being an
operations professional.

405
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,082
Jeff is a big stickler
for the metric system.

406
00:22:17,082 --> 00:22:19,718
And so, fortunately,
Spotlight has my back.

407
00:22:19,718 --> 00:22:23,823
I can just type in
16.4 miles here

408
00:22:23,823 --> 00:22:27,059
and I get an instant
conversion to kilometers.

409
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,360
So that's awfully handy.

410
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,962
We do all kinds of conversion.

411
00:22:29,962 --> 00:22:33,299
They drop that in, fix
that document right up.

Well, that's enough
for my document.

415
00:22:38,337 --> 00:22:41,440
I can also do great searches
like just type a few characters,

416
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:46,078
bang, I've got Yosemite
entry from Wikipedia.

I've got news from
various sources.

418
00:22:49,448 --> 00:22:52,618
I even have maps right here.

419
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:55,855
Well, you know, I'm looking to
plan a dinner and maybe a movie

420
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:58,090
out and now without
even launching an app,

421
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:00,559
I can just do a look up
for sushi for instance.

422
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,796
And we see I have maps

423

to map information,

425
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:10,369
we've got pictures,

to go out to a movie.

in Godzilla here.

apps that are local

to your Mac you can
get a content from apps

So, Mail in Yosemite has an
elegant new Yosemite style UI.

on the basics,

between mailboxes, quick fetches

to address a fundamental problem

00:25:22,668 --> 00:25:26,005
with email, which is these
days we so often want

465
00:25:26,005 --> 00:25:28,207
to send large attachments
whether it's videos

recipient's mail server can't

take those large attachments.

Well, we're solving that problem

470
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:41,186
with the technology
we call Mail Drop.

your message bouncing off your

recipient's mail
server, you can elect

473
00:25:47,826 --> 00:25:50,229
to have the attachment
sent encrypted

474
00:25:50,229 --> 00:25:53,098

separate from the message

and it rendezvous on
the receiving end.

So, if your recipient has a Mac,
they get it just like before.

477
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,841

client, they get a link

to securely download
those attachments.

be up to 5 gigs in size.

signature right on the trackpad

into the email message

in your Safari sidebar
under Shared Links.

519
00:27:54,887 --> 00:27:58,524
And you can also share to
people more quickly than ever,

520
00:27:58,524 --> 00:28:00,292
because Safari lists the
people you've message

521
00:28:00,292 --> 00:28:03,762
with most recently, and with
just one click you can share

522
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,531
a webpage.

523
00:28:05,531 --> 00:28:09,968
Now, Safari is better than
ever as well with tabs.

524
00:28:09,968 --> 00:28:13,705
We now have a tab view that
gives you a bird's-eye glance

525
00:28:13,705 --> 00:28:18,043
of all of your tabs and it
stacks tabs from sites just

526
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:20,078
like this so you get
individual stacks

527
00:28:20,078 --> 00:28:23,382
for each site that
you're browsing.

528
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:26,185
Safari is also great
when it comes to privacy.

529
00:28:26,185 --> 00:28:29,188
Safari was the first browser
to introduce private browsing

530
00:28:29,188 --> 00:28:30,889
and now it's easier than ever,

531
00:28:30,889 --> 00:28:33,759
because you can create
a new private window.

532
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:36,795
And when you do, all the
content within that window

533
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:39,598
and all its tabs
stay private and all

534
00:28:39,598 --> 00:28:42,534
of your other windows
are unaffected.

535
00:28:42,534 --> 00:28:44,069
It's really handy.

536
00:28:44,069 --> 00:28:47,372
Now, Safari is great when
it comes to standards.

537
00:28:47,372 --> 00:28:51,276
It has WebGL now for
superfast 3D graphics,

538
00:28:51,276 --> 00:28:56,481
SPDY for efficient networking,
and HTML Premium Video.

539
00:28:56,481 --> 00:29:01,320
Now, this enables modern Macs
to efficiently stream video

540
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,689
from site like Netflix
without a plug-in

541
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:06,158
and the results are awesome.

542
00:29:06,158 --> 00:29:09,361
You get up to two hours
longer battery life

543
00:29:09,361 --> 00:29:11,597
on a MacBook Air
streaming Netflix.

544
00:29:11,597 --> 00:29:14,266
And that's for 1080P video.

545
00:29:14,266 --> 00:29:17,736
Now, Safari has been
set the benchmark really

546
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:20,539
for energy efficiency
since Mavericks

547
00:29:20,539 --> 00:29:22,875
and its lead here continues.

548
00:29:22,875 --> 00:29:26,311
When it comes to multi-tab
browser energy efficiency,

549
00:29:26,311 --> 00:29:28,280
Safari is without equal.

550
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,549
And when it comes to the
kind of UI manipulations

551
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:35,387
that are typical in web apps,
Safari is faster than ever.

552
00:29:35,387 --> 00:29:36,955
And how about JavaScript?

553
00:29:36,955 --> 00:29:39,958
Well, take the most complex kind
of JavaScript that's typical

554
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:42,327
of very rich web applications.

555
00:29:42,327 --> 00:29:47,466
Well, Safari now has a Fourth
Tier LLVM-based optimized

556
00:29:47,466 --> 00:29:52,371
JavaScript Compiler that is the
fastest of any major browser.

557
00:29:52,371 --> 00:29:57,242
And when it comes to
typical website JavaScript,

558
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:00,012
Safari is in a league
of its own.

559
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:01,146
So of that is Safari.

560
00:30:01,146 --> 00:30:03,548
And to give you a quick
demo, I'd like to bring

561
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:05,217
up Brian Crowe to the stage.

562
00:30:05,217 --> 00:30:05,851
Let's give him a big welcome.

563
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:06,551
Brian.

564
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:11,723
[ Applause ]

565
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:14,092
Thanks Craig.

566
00:30:14,092 --> 00:30:16,328
I'm really happy
to be here today.

567
00:30:16,328 --> 00:30:19,097
So, I'm just going to
dive right into Safari.

568
00:30:19,097 --> 00:30:20,332
Here we go.

569
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:23,101
It's really great.

570
00:30:23,101 --> 00:30:26,371
And when you go to a website,

571
00:30:26,371 --> 00:30:29,207
you can really appreciate
the new design.

572
00:30:29,207 --> 00:30:32,811
It's simpler and it's
even more powerful.

573
00:30:32,811 --> 00:30:36,949
I can open up the sidebar really
easily to get at my Bookmarks,

574
00:30:36,949 --> 00:30:40,218
my Reading List as well
as my Shared Links.

575
00:30:40,218 --> 00:30:46,558
And when I click into the Search
field, I get instant access

576
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:48,360
to all my favorite sites.

577
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,828
It's really nice.

578
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:51,029
So, I'm going to
go ahead and type

579
00:30:51,029 --> 00:30:53,498
in a search for Ansel Adams.

580
00:30:53,498 --> 00:30:55,000
There we go.

581
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,336
And if I hit return,
I can just go

582
00:30:57,336 --> 00:30:59,905
to a regular old Google search.

583
00:30:59,905 --> 00:31:04,910
But, since Ansel Adams
is a common search term,

584
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,747
I get this new Spotlight
suggestion there at the top.

585
00:31:08,747 --> 00:31:11,183
It has a snippet of
information from Wikipedia.

586
00:31:11,183 --> 00:31:14,953
I can read it there, or
if I'd like I can go ahead

587
00:31:14,953 --> 00:31:18,824
and see the entire article
right on the Wikipedia site.

588
00:31:18,824 --> 00:31:21,293
It's super convenient.

589
00:31:21,293 --> 00:31:27,032
Now, if you use tabs,
you're going to love this.

590
00:31:27,032 --> 00:31:30,602
Now, no matter how many
tabs I have opened,

591
00:31:30,602 --> 00:31:34,006
I can smoothly scroll
through them to get at any

592
00:31:34,006 --> 00:31:35,674
of that tab I'm looking for.

593
00:31:35,674 --> 00:31:37,142
It's really nice.

594
00:31:37,142 --> 00:31:39,211
[ Applause ]

595
00:31:39,211 --> 00:31:42,814
So now, sometimes I want to
see my tabs so I can go ahead

596
00:31:42,814 --> 00:31:46,251
and do this and I'll click
on the new Tab View button.

597
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:49,121
And there you go, a
beautiful bird's eye view

598
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:50,389
of all my open tabs.

599
00:31:50,389 --> 00:31:53,625
So, I'm going to go ahead
and select this one here.

600
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:57,129
It's a photoblog with a
bunch of pictures of Yosemite

601
00:31:57,129 --> 00:32:00,732
and there's a couple of good
ones of El Capitan down below.

602
00:32:00,732 --> 00:32:02,834
So, I'll find in
there El Capitan.

603
00:32:02,834 --> 00:32:04,970
And then I'm going
to choose this one.

604
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,505
Now, I want to share it
with Craig so I'm going

605
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:08,073
to get the high-res image.

606
00:32:08,073 --> 00:32:10,609
Now, sharing couldn't
be easier in Safari.

607
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:13,478
I just simply click on
the Share button here,

608
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:16,815
and now I can use the new
recent recipients feature

609
00:32:16,815 --> 00:32:18,784
to address it to Craig.

610
00:32:18,784 --> 00:32:20,986
And here we go.

611
00:32:20,986 --> 00:32:24,790
And with just one click, I'm
ready to send that image.

612
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:26,591
It's that easy.

613
00:32:26,591 --> 00:32:29,027
So-- But before I send it,

614
00:32:29,027 --> 00:32:31,530
I'm going to add my
two cents to this.

615
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:34,032
So, I can go here and we
have just the right feature

616
00:32:34,032 --> 00:32:35,634
called Markup.

617
00:32:35,634 --> 00:32:38,603
Now with Markup, I
can edit this image

618
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:40,972
without ever even leaving Mail.

619
00:32:40,972 --> 00:32:42,474
It's really great.

620
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:45,410
So, what I'm going to do
is annotate this image

621
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,947
with a nice magnifying
glass a loop.

622
00:32:48,947 --> 00:32:50,615
So, you move it around
you can say

623
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:52,317
that it magnifies
everything underneath it.

624
00:32:52,317 --> 00:32:54,586
So, I'm going to
place it right here.

625
00:32:54,586 --> 00:32:57,722
And it turns out
that those two specs

626
00:32:57,722 --> 00:33:01,126
on the big granite face there,
they're actually climbers.

627
00:33:01,126 --> 00:33:02,127
It's kind of crazy.

628
00:33:02,127 --> 00:33:03,462
So, I'm going to
zoom it a little more

629
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:04,763
so you can see it better.

630
00:33:04,763 --> 00:33:06,364
There we go.

631
00:33:06,364 --> 00:33:09,201
So, I can zoom nicely
and place it here.

632
00:33:09,201 --> 00:33:12,571
Now, I want to point this
out to Craig in the mail.

633
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:16,575
And I can use my trackpad
to draw on the image.

634
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:19,177
So, I'm going to go ahead
and draw an arrow here.

635
00:33:19,177 --> 00:33:21,279
There we go.

636
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,117
And you notice Markup's smart
enough to recognize the arrow

637
00:33:25,117 --> 00:33:27,586
and make it really pretty.

638
00:33:27,586 --> 00:33:32,591
So now-- now, it's really
easy to add a comment.

639
00:33:32,591 --> 00:33:36,628
And so, check out the climbers.

640
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,029
There we go.

641
00:33:38,029 --> 00:33:41,533
Now, I can have a little
fun with this, so I'm going

642
00:33:41,533 --> 00:33:45,070
to go ahead and create
a cartoon bubble, OK?

643
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:48,907
I'm not so good at drawing
but Markup's going to help me.

644
00:33:48,907 --> 00:33:50,809
There we go.

645
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:52,144
So, luckily you can
clean that up [phonetic],

646
00:33:52,144 --> 00:33:53,578
it's better than I am.

647
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:56,148
So now I can add a caption.

648
00:33:56,148 --> 00:33:57,883
And so, I think I'm
going to appeal

649
00:33:57,883 --> 00:33:59,784
to the inner developer
and all of us.

650
00:33:59,784 --> 00:34:05,991
I'm going to type in
"I hope the rope is,"

651
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:09,461
wait for it, "multithreaded."

652
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,531
Yeah.

653
00:34:12,531 --> 00:34:15,734
[ Laughter ]

654
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:18,570
OK. So, I think I've done
enough to this picture.

655
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,572
Time to go.

656
00:34:21,572 --> 00:34:23,340
So, now it's ready
for me to mail

657
00:34:23,341 --> 00:34:25,310
and I can just click like that.

658
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,047
So that's how easy it is
to Markup an image in Mail.

659
00:34:30,047 --> 00:34:31,315
So, those are just a couple

660
00:34:31,315 --> 00:34:34,585
of great new features
in Safari in Mail.

661
00:34:34,585 --> 00:34:35,553
Thank you.

662
00:34:35,554 --> 00:34:43,795
[ Applause ]

663
00:34:43,795 --> 00:34:45,563
How about that
parallel programming joke.

664
00:34:45,563 --> 00:34:47,765
You did not see that coming.

665
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,670
Next, something entirely
different.

666
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,738
It's called the Continuity.

667
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:57,007
So now at Apple, we
believe you should be able

668
00:34:57,007 --> 00:34:59,911
to use the right
device for the moment.

669
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:04,015
Maybe your phone when you're on
the go, your iPad when you want

670
00:35:04,015 --> 00:35:06,551
to kick back on the
couch, or maybe your Mac

671
00:35:06,551 --> 00:35:08,086
when you're trying to
get some work done.

672
00:35:08,086 --> 00:35:12,190
But we also want the transitions
between these moments

673
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:16,861
to be absolutely as natural
and seamless as possible.

674
00:35:16,861 --> 00:35:20,165
Now, our Continuity features
start with something simple

675
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:22,968
and that's AirDrop,
because now AirDrop works

676
00:35:22,968 --> 00:35:24,536
between iOS and the Mac.

677
00:35:24,536 --> 00:35:32,644
[ Applause ]

678
00:35:32,644 --> 00:35:35,180
It's really convenient.

679
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,915
But now we have something
that we really take it

680
00:35:36,915 --> 00:35:40,418
to the next level and
that's called Handoff.

681
00:35:40,418 --> 00:35:45,991
So, it turns out now that when
you're working on your Mac,

682
00:35:45,991 --> 00:35:50,295
your devices around you
in proximity are aware

683
00:35:50,295 --> 00:35:53,698
of each other and aware
of what you're up to.

684
00:35:53,698 --> 00:35:56,601
And so, if you want to pick up
where you left off on your Mac

685
00:35:56,601 --> 00:35:59,804
and your iPad, your iPad
is prompting you right

686
00:35:59,804 --> 00:36:01,539
in the lower left of the screen.

687
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:04,643
Just swipe up and you
can pick up working

688
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:07,279
on what you're working on

notice what you're doing

Now, we've been able to take
this same proximity awareness

automatically sets up a hotspot.

00:44:27,111 --> 00:44:29,180
I'm just glad I'm
in the beta program.

863
00:44:29,180 --> 00:44:31,315
[ Laughter ]

864
00:44:31,315 --> 00:44:33,551
Next up is iOS.

865
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:37,021
[ Applause ]

866
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:44,195
We've now sold well over 800
million iOS devices and each

867
00:44:44,195 --> 00:44:47,999
of the categories of devices has
set its own significant sales

868
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,101
record in the past year.

869
00:44:50,101 --> 00:44:54,739
iPod Touch has passed
100 million units.

870
00:44:54,739 --> 00:44:58,776
iPad has passed 200
million units.

871
00:44:58,776 --> 00:45:03,614
And iPhone has passed
half a billion units.

872
00:45:03,614 --> 00:45:05,550
This is incredible.

873
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:10,555
But what's even more impressive
is how many new customers

874
00:45:10,555 --> 00:45:15,560
to Apple that iOS
devices has brought to us.

875
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:22,099
Over 130 million customers
who bought an iOS device

876
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:28,539
in the past 12 months was
buying their first Apple device.

877
00:45:28,539 --> 00:45:34,645
[ Applause ]

878
00:45:34,645 --> 00:45:41,385
Now, many of these customers
were switchers from Android.

879
00:45:42,587 --> 00:45:48,159
They had bought an
Android phone by mistake.

880
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,261
[ Laughter ]

881
00:45:50,261 --> 00:45:56,267
And then had sought a better
experience and a better life.

882
00:45:56,267 --> 00:45:58,469
[ Laughter ]

883
00:45:58,469 --> 00:46:03,841
And decided to check
out iPhone and iOS.

884
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:09,614
Nearly, in fact, nearly half
of our customers in China

885
00:46:09,614 --> 00:46:15,853
in the past six months
switched from Android to iPhone.

886
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:17,955
This is incredible and of course

887
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:22,793
that better experience
is our devices in iOS.

888
00:46:22,793 --> 00:46:27,665
And iOS 7 took that
experience to even higher level.

889
00:46:27,665 --> 00:46:33,437
The customer sat with iOS
7 is really off the charts.

890
00:46:33,437 --> 00:46:38,676
Change wave recently
measured it at 97 percent.

891
00:46:38,676 --> 00:46:43,314
These are customer sat
ratings that no one gets.

892
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:46,050
It's really enormous.

893
00:46:46,050 --> 00:46:53,858
Now, one of the reasons why
customers say they love iOS is

894
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:58,095
that we make available
our software updates

895
00:46:58,095 --> 00:47:02,867
for the OS available to as
many customers as possible.

896
00:47:02,867 --> 00:47:07,405
And, if you look at what
has happened with iOS 7,

897
00:47:07,405 --> 00:47:11,842
our latest release,
almost 9 out of 10 people

898
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:16,514
in our install base are running
our latest operating system.

899
00:47:16,514 --> 00:47:22,954
[ Applause ]

900
00:47:22,954 --> 00:47:26,457
Now, this is in stark
contrast to Android.

901
00:47:26,457 --> 00:47:28,859
[ Laughter ]

902
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:33,431
If you look at their latest
release, less than one out of 10

903
00:47:33,431 --> 00:47:37,668
of their customers are
on their latest software.

904
00:47:37,668 --> 00:47:43,741
And, if you look at a
broader group, over a third

905
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:47,044
of their customers
are running a version

906
00:47:47,044 --> 00:47:52,316
of Android from four years ago.

907
00:47:52,316 --> 00:47:54,552
That's like ancient history.

908
00:47:54,552 --> 00:47:57,655
[ Laughter ]

909
00:47:57,655 --> 00:48:02,593
Now, that means that these
customers are not getting great

910
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:04,428
new features.

911
00:48:04,428 --> 00:48:08,099
They're not able to
run your latest apps.

912
00:48:08,099 --> 00:48:11,602
And, they don't get
security updates

913
00:48:11,602 --> 00:48:15,139
that they may need to stay safe.

914
00:48:15,139 --> 00:48:18,542
And, this is particularly
important for Android

915
00:48:18,542 --> 00:48:21,512
which dominates the
mobile malware market.

916
00:48:21,512 --> 00:48:24,648
[ Laughter ]

917
00:48:24,648 --> 00:48:29,453
No wonder experts are
saying things like this.

918
00:48:29,453 --> 00:48:31,956
Android fragmentation
is turning devices

919
00:48:31,956 --> 00:48:37,194
into a toxic hell stew
of vulnerabilities.

920
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:44,635
Now, fortunately, iOS hasn't
had this kind of issues

921
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:49,173
because we do everything we can
to make our updates available

922
00:48:49,173 --> 00:48:51,976
to as many people as possible.

923
00:48:51,976 --> 00:48:58,482
So, we could not be
happier with iOS 7

924
00:48:58,482 --> 00:49:00,684
and the momentum of iOS devices.

925
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:05,122
But, we are not standing still.

926
00:49:05,122 --> 00:49:08,492
Today, we're announcing iOS 8.

927
00:49:08,492 --> 00:49:16,033
[ Applause ]

928
00:49:16,033 --> 00:49:19,937
And, iOS 8 is a giant release

929
00:49:19,937 --> 00:49:23,240
and it's really two
stories not one.

930
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:27,545
It has great end user features.

931
00:49:27,545 --> 00:49:32,383
But, it also has
incredible developer features

932
00:49:32,383 --> 00:49:36,887
so you can extend your
experience and build apps

933
00:49:36,887 --> 00:49:39,790
that you couldn't do before.

934
00:49:39,790 --> 00:49:43,360
We'd like to get started with
describing it with talking

935
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:45,463
about the end user features.

936
00:49:45,463 --> 00:49:48,265
And, to do that, I'd
like to bring Craig back

937
00:49:48,265 --> 00:49:48,699
up to the stage.

938
00:49:48,699 --> 00:49:49,533
Craig?

939
00:49:49,533 --> 00:49:57,074
[ Applause ]

940
00:49:57,074 --> 00:49:58,742
I missed you guys.

941
00:49:58,742 --> 00:50:03,314
So, what? Let's talk
about iOS 8.

942
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:08,586
Now, iOS 8 of course builds
on the design of iOS 7

943
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:12,189
with enhancements for
both iPhone and iPad.

944
00:50:12,189 --> 00:50:14,391
And, let's start with the phone.

945
00:50:14,391 --> 00:50:18,762
Now, in iOS 8, we've
refined notification center.

946
00:50:18,762 --> 00:50:24,235
But, what I really love are our
new interactive notifications.

947
00:50:24,235 --> 00:50:28,572
So now, if you get a message
like this, just pull down

948
00:50:28,572 --> 00:50:31,108
and you can reply from
right where you are.

949
00:50:31,108 --> 00:50:33,110
[ Applause ]

950
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,778
You don't have to leave
the app you're in.

951
00:50:34,778 --> 00:50:37,615
And this works for all
kinds of notifications.

952
00:50:37,615 --> 00:50:40,384
If you get a calendar event
for instance, just pull down

953
00:50:40,384 --> 00:50:44,221
and respond and it works
on the lock screen.

954
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:46,357
So, you can just swipe
across in the lock screen.

955
00:50:46,357 --> 00:50:48,225
You get those action
buttons tapped

956
00:50:48,225 --> 00:50:50,928
and you've dealt
with it right there.

957
00:50:50,928 --> 00:50:55,032
Now, in iOS 7, we gave you
quick double-tap access to get

958
00:50:55,032 --> 00:50:57,034
at your most recent apps.

959
00:50:57,034 --> 00:51:00,404
Well now, you can also use
that same double tap to get

960
00:51:00,404 --> 00:51:04,008
at the people you communicate
with most frequently.

961
00:51:04,008 --> 00:51:05,709
It's really handy.

962
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:10,681
And, in iOS 7, we introduce
this great Tab View in Safari.

963
00:51:10,681 --> 00:51:13,951
Well, we're bringing a great
Tab View to iPad as well

964
00:51:13,951 --> 00:51:17,154
with this bird's eye
view of all of your tabs.

965
00:51:17,154 --> 00:51:21,192
And, Safari also picks up
the Side Bar that we love

966
00:51:21,192 --> 00:51:24,962
in Yosemite with access to your
bookmarks, your reading list

967
00:51:24,962 --> 00:51:26,730
and your shared links.

968
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:30,467
Now, we've made managing your
mail easier than ever before.

969
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,603
So now, if you're reading a
message, you want to remember

970
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:34,672
to get back to it so you're
going to mark it on red.

971
00:51:34,672 --> 00:51:37,408
We can do that with
just a single gesture.

972
00:51:37,408 --> 00:51:39,643
And, if you want
to flag a message,

973
00:51:39,643 --> 00:51:41,378
you can just pull across,
there's a flag option.

974
00:51:41,378 --> 00:51:43,080
But, if you pull
all the way across,

975
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:45,716
you can delete with
just a gesture.

976
00:51:45,716 --> 00:51:48,452
But the piece I love the
best is what we've done

977
00:51:48,452 --> 00:51:50,020
with composing messages.

978
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:52,489
Have you ever found
yourself composing an email

979
00:51:52,489 --> 00:51:55,092
and then you really wish like
you get at something else

980
00:51:55,092 --> 00:51:57,761
in your inbox maybe
for that reply?

981
00:51:57,761 --> 00:51:58,896
Well now, you can.

982
00:51:58,896 --> 00:52:01,966
Just swipe that message
down and you have access

983
00:52:01,966 --> 00:52:03,534
to the rest of your mail.

984
00:52:03,534 --> 00:52:09,673
[ Applause ]

985
00:52:09,673 --> 00:52:11,141
So, I'd like to give
you a demo of some

986
00:52:11,141 --> 00:52:17,014
of these great iOS
8 enhancements now.

987
00:52:17,014 --> 00:52:22,586
So, here we are on
our iOS 8 lock screen.

988
00:52:22,586 --> 00:52:24,455
And, if I receive
a notification,

989
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:26,857
it looks like I happen to
get one just right then,

990
00:52:26,857 --> 00:52:30,794
I can swipe across and you see
I have action so I can accept

991
00:52:30,794 --> 00:52:32,096
or decline this meeting
right here.

992
00:52:32,096 --> 00:52:35,499
And, of course, I'm
going to use the device,

993
00:52:35,499 --> 00:52:39,870
if I'm in here maybe playing
some music here on iTunes radio,

994
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:43,173
I might get a notification.

995
00:52:43,173 --> 00:52:47,411
And, if I do get notification, I
can just swipe down on it, too.

996
00:52:47,411 --> 00:52:49,813
So, here's one, just swipe down.

997
00:52:49,813 --> 00:52:51,915
Now, I get access
to my keyboard.

998
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,451
I can type right there.

999
00:52:54,451 --> 00:52:57,221
Now, this works great for
third party apps as well.

1000
00:52:57,221 --> 00:53:00,457
So, for instance, looks like
I got tagged on Facebook,

1001
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:04,428
I can like it right here with
an actionable notification.

1002
00:53:04,428 --> 00:53:06,063
And, sometimes, you
receive notifications

1003
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:07,898
that you just really don't
want deal with right now

1004
00:53:07,898 --> 00:53:11,268
and you can just flick
those away like that.

1005
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,636
That's really handy.

1006
00:53:12,636 --> 00:53:15,806
Now, we've made getting at
people easier than ever before.

1007
00:53:15,806 --> 00:53:17,374
So, if I just double-tap
my Home button,

1008
00:53:17,374 --> 00:53:20,811
so I have all the people I most
recently communicated with.

1009
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:24,481
I swipe to the side and I have
access to all my favorites.

1010
00:53:24,481 --> 00:53:28,519
If I tap on one, I have controls
here to give them a phone call,

1011
00:53:28,519 --> 00:53:32,289
iMessage them or even
FaceTime right here

1012
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:35,426
with just a double-tap
on the Home button.

1013
00:53:35,426 --> 00:53:37,094
It's really handy.

1014
00:53:37,094 --> 00:53:38,128
Now, I want to show you some

1015
00:53:38,128 --> 00:53:40,631
of the enhancements
we made to mail.

1016
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:44,401
Let's go take a look an
iPad actually this time.

1017
00:53:44,401 --> 00:53:45,269
So, here we are on iPad.

1018
00:53:45,269 --> 00:53:47,971
I'm going to launch mail.

1019
00:53:47,971 --> 00:53:50,507
Now, I have a number
of unread messages here

1020
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:52,209
so let's work our
way through them.

1021
00:53:52,209 --> 00:53:56,580
Here's a message from Open
Table with a dinner appointment.

1022
00:53:56,580 --> 00:54:01,185
And, you notice that the
reservation is actually called

1023
00:54:01,185 --> 00:54:02,553
out right here on the top.

1024
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:05,055
Mail has actually given me an
intelligent suggestion here

1025
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,156
to add it to my calendar.

1026
00:54:06,156 --> 00:54:08,826
I can tap Add and just
like this, it lets--

1027
00:54:08,826 --> 00:54:12,463
it prompts me to fill out and
add an event to my calendar.

1028
00:54:12,463 --> 00:54:14,131
That's really handy.

1029
00:54:14,131 --> 00:54:16,367
Now, sometimes, you
get a message like this

1030
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:18,168
where you're going to have
to do some thinking about it.

1031
00:54:18,168 --> 00:54:19,536
Maybe get back to it later.

1032
00:54:19,536 --> 00:54:23,874
Well now, with just a single
swipe, I can mark it as unread.

1033
00:54:23,874 --> 00:54:25,275
It's really cool.

1034
00:54:25,275 --> 00:54:27,211
You can also flag really easily.

1035
00:54:27,211 --> 00:54:29,313
So, this is a message
I want to flag.

1036
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:32,649
Just flick it across and flag.

1037
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,051
Now, here's a nice message.

I don't know who this fellow is
but he says great collaboration.

You and Johnny have really
come together really well.

Let's take a look at that one.

1043
00:54:44,361 --> 00:54:45,496
Well, this would be a good time

1044
00:54:45,496 --> 00:54:47,898
to demonstrate our
quick delete feature.

1045
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:51,034
So, I can drag all the way
across and delete at a glance.

1046
00:54:51,034 --> 00:54:52,770
I'm certain that
message won't haunt me

on the internet for
years to come.

1048
00:54:55,672 --> 00:54:57,040
So, let's talk about composing.

1049
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,277
I got a message here from a
friend who's visiting in town,

1050
00:55:00,277 --> 00:55:01,378
who's looking for
a good restaurant.

1051
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:03,847
So, I'll start replying
to this message.

1052
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:08,218
And, I'll say, let's see--
check out and then, you know,

1053
00:55:08,218 --> 00:55:09,953
actually I got a
good recommendation

1054
00:55:09,953 --> 00:55:11,355
from another friend
here in my inbox,

1055
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:12,656
so I'd like to get to that now.

1056
00:55:12,656 --> 00:55:16,860
Well, I can just swipe
this draft down like this.

1057
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,962
Go right into another
place, another message

1058
00:55:18,962 --> 00:55:23,100
in my inbox, tap
out a selection.

1059
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,768
That looks like exactly
what I want to send him

1060
00:55:24,768 --> 00:55:25,836
so I'll just copy that.

1061
00:55:25,836 --> 00:55:27,404
And now, with a tap
at the bottom,

1062
00:55:27,404 --> 00:55:30,674
I restore my draft
just like that.

1063
00:55:30,674 --> 00:55:33,477
I can paste and send
it on its way.

1064
00:55:33,477 --> 00:55:36,346
I think we're all going to
love doing mail this way.

1065
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:39,550
That's a quick look, few
enhancements to iOS 8.

[ Applause ]

1067
00:55:44,221 --> 00:55:46,457
So, let's talk about Spotlight.

1068
00:55:46,457 --> 00:55:48,792
And of course, Spotlight
is a super convenient way

1069
00:55:48,792 --> 00:55:49,893
to search in your device.

1070
00:55:49,893 --> 00:55:51,929
You just pull down one
on your home screen

1071
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:53,363
and you can execute
these searches,

1072
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:57,100
find things like launching
apps or find an email message.

1073
00:55:57,100 --> 00:56:00,170
But now, with those same things
we showed you in Yosemite,

1074
00:56:00,170 --> 00:56:03,907
with Spotlight Suggestions,
you can get it so much more.

1075
00:56:03,907 --> 00:56:06,743
You can search for apps and find
matches of apps that you don't

1076
00:56:06,743 --> 00:56:09,012
yet have on the App Store.

1077
00:56:09,012 --> 00:56:11,014
You can search for
points of interest

1078
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:13,817
and get Wikipedia
entries and directions.

1079
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:19,156
You can search for news,
search for restaurants, songs,

1080
00:56:19,156 --> 00:56:21,925
not just in your own
library but also on iTunes.

1081
00:56:21,925 --> 00:56:25,262
And, when you search for a
movie, you can get results both

1082
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:30,834
for theaters nearby as well as
content available for streaming.

1083
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:34,938
And, when you search
inside of Safari in addition

1084
00:56:34,938 --> 00:56:37,274
to your great Google
Search suggestions,

1085
00:56:37,274 --> 00:56:39,643
you can also get a
suggestion at a glance

1086
00:56:39,643 --> 00:56:41,712
for the answer you're
looking for right

1087
00:56:41,712 --> 00:56:43,747
from Spotlight Suggestions.

1088
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:46,183
So, that is the new Spotlight.

1089
00:56:46,183 --> 00:56:52,189
Next, the keyboard and the
technology we call QuickType.

1090
00:56:52,189 --> 00:56:53,056
Oh.

1091
00:56:53,056 --> 00:56:54,825
[ Laughter ]

1092
00:56:54,825 --> 00:56:59,162
So, prior to iPhone, this
was the state-of-the-art

1093
00:56:59,162 --> 00:57:00,631
in smartphone typing.

1094
00:57:00,631 --> 00:57:04,134
But, iPhone changed all of that
with the introduction of Touch.

1095
00:57:04,134 --> 00:57:07,538
And, we've been able to do
so much more like access

1096
00:57:07,538 --> 00:57:11,375
to special characters or
alternate character sets,

1097
00:57:11,375 --> 00:57:16,413
special keyboard layouts, even
handwriting and dictation.

1098
00:57:16,413 --> 00:57:20,684
But, underlying it all have
been the language models

1099
00:57:20,684 --> 00:57:22,953
under autocorrect.

1100
00:57:22,953 --> 00:57:28,158
Well now, in iOS 8,
QuickType supports predictive

1101
00:57:28,158 --> 00:57:29,693
typing suggestions.

1102
00:57:29,693 --> 00:57:32,596
So, as you type,
you get suggestions

1103
00:57:32,596 --> 00:57:34,631
for the next words you
might want to type,

1104
00:57:34,631 --> 00:57:38,168
and you can tap things out
faster than ever before

1105
00:57:38,168 --> 00:57:40,337
and it's incredibly smart.

1106
00:57:40,337 --> 00:57:42,406
So, it's context sensitive.

1107
00:57:42,406 --> 00:57:44,308
For instance in messages,
if someone asks you,

1108
00:57:44,308 --> 00:57:45,609
do you want to go for
dinner or a movie?

1109
00:57:45,609 --> 00:57:48,545

dinner or a movie.

00:57:56,987 --> 00:57:58,188
And, it's personalized.

1112
00:57:58,188 --> 00:57:59,623
It learns how you type

1113
00:57:59,623 --> 00:58:01,825
to different people
in different apps.

1114
00:58:01,825 --> 00:58:04,394
So, maybe you're communicating
with a co-worker and it's going

1115
00:58:04,394 --> 00:58:07,431
to say, well, the meeting was
canceled, rescheduled, moved.

1116
00:58:07,431 --> 00:58:09,866
These are kind of formal terms.

1117
00:58:09,866 --> 00:58:11,234
But now, if you're
communicating with someone else,

1118
00:58:11,234 --> 00:58:13,904
we have a different
communication style,

1119
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:17,541
you might get the meeting was
epic, awesome or a snoozer

1120
00:58:17,541 --> 00:58:20,577
because it learns how you type.

1121
00:58:20,577 --> 00:58:22,245
And, when it does, it does

1122
00:58:22,245 --> 00:58:25,682
so in a way that's always
protecting your privacy.

1123
00:58:25,682 --> 00:58:28,318
All that learning is done
local to the device and none

1124
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:31,121
of your keystrokes
leave the device.

1125
00:58:31,121 --> 00:58:33,657
Now, QuickType has
great language models

1126
00:58:33,657 --> 00:58:35,525
for all of these languages.

up where you left
off on your iPhone.

1133

with no configuration
on your iPad.

in the upper right hand
corner is this Details button.

can do is add contacts.

I can add people to this

but I can also choose
to share my location.

01:01:44,648 --> 01:01:46,883
Well now, I can just
choose to Do Not Disturb

1199
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:50,187
that particular thread and
not get my phone buzzing.

1200
01:01:50,187 --> 01:01:51,688
So, I'm going to find
that useful with Kim

1201
01:01:51,688 --> 01:01:54,257
and Craig, I know that for sure.

1202
01:01:54,257 --> 01:01:55,959
Or I can even Leave
this Conversation

1203
01:01:55,959 --> 01:01:57,494
with just a single tap.

1204
01:01:57,494 --> 01:01:58,962
What's also convenient
is the fact

1205
01:01:58,962 --> 01:02:01,631
that I have all the
attachments, all the photos

1206
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:03,733
from this conversation
all in one place.

1207
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:07,237
So they still appear in line
in the thread but now instead

1208
01:02:07,237 --> 01:02:09,539
of trying to find that picture
by scrolling, scrolling,

1209
01:02:09,539 --> 01:02:12,375
scrolling, they all come in
one place here in the thread,

1210
01:02:12,375 --> 01:02:13,743
so very, very convenient.

1211
01:02:13,743 --> 01:02:15,512
So let's go back to
that conversation,

1212
01:02:15,512 --> 01:02:17,180
Kim had asked me how it's going.

1213
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:18,949
Well, I have lots of
ways to reply to her.

1214
01:02:18,949 --> 01:02:21,351
I could tap out which just
a few taps and, you know,

1215
01:02:21,351 --> 01:02:23,620
use my predictive
keyboard, a message.

1216
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:26,756
But it's even cooler that I can
now do an audio or video message

1217
01:02:26,756 --> 01:02:28,558
to her with just a swipe.

1218
01:02:28,558 --> 01:02:32,028
So I'll send back an
audio message to her.

1219
01:02:32,028 --> 01:02:35,832
Hey Kim, I'm just hanging
out here with about 6,000

Slide up, sends the
message just like that.

1224
01:02:44,007 --> 01:02:45,342
Super easy.

1225
01:02:45,342 --> 01:02:47,310
And I can do the same
thing with a video message

1226
01:02:47,310 --> 01:02:48,411
or even with a selfie.

1227
01:02:48,411 --> 01:02:50,113
So I'm going to dare
a selfie here.

1228
01:02:50,113 --> 01:02:53,583

01:03:02,626 --> 01:03:03,693
Not my best look.

1231
01:03:03,693 --> 01:03:06,496
Let's see what Kim
has to say about that.

1232
01:03:06,496 --> 01:03:08,865
So, I can-- see, I got an
audio message from Kim,

1233
01:03:08,865 --> 01:03:11,968
all I have to do is tap the play
button and hear the message.

1234
01:03:11,968 --> 01:03:13,103
Impressive Jos.

1235
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:16,473
You've totally mastered
the duck face selfie.

1236
01:03:16,473 --> 01:03:18,508
Well, I'm glad she likes it.

1237
01:03:18,508 --> 01:03:21,544
So it's super duper easy
to do this sort of things.

1238
01:03:21,544 --> 01:03:23,513
You notice that it said it
would expire in a couple

1239
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:25,415
of minutes 'cause you don't
want to have this clean this up.

1240
01:03:25,415 --> 01:03:27,150
Audio and video messages
can take up space

1241
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:28,652
so it self-destruct
unless you choose

1242
01:03:28,652 --> 01:03:30,654
to keep-- whoa, what's this?

1243
01:03:30,654 --> 01:03:32,055
So Craig should be backstage

1244
01:03:32,055 --> 01:03:34,157
but he apparently has sent me a
message and it looks important.

1245
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:35,558
So if you don't mind I'm
going to play it back.

1246
01:03:35,558 --> 01:03:38,328
And I can play it back in line
even with a video message here.

1247
01:03:38,328 --> 01:03:42,666
Jos, we got a serious
situation developing back here.

1248
01:03:42,666 --> 01:03:43,767
I can't control this.

Bryan, you got
to do something.

1251
01:03:47,237 --> 01:03:51,074
I got it.

01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:53,576
Jos, I'm going to need
you to buy some more time.

[ Laughter & Applause ]

1254

Needless to say, hair
like that doesn't come easy.

1255
01:04:04,554 --> 01:04:07,290
So while he's dealing with
his crisis backstage--

1256
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:09,659
oh look, I've actually got
an audio message from him.

1257
01:04:09,659 --> 01:04:11,861
Now, what's really cool
is I can actually listen

1258
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,864
to audio messages and reply to
them from the lock screen simply

1259
01:04:14,864 --> 01:04:16,833
by raising the iPhone to my ear.

1260

Hey Jos, we got the
crisis contained back here.

1261
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:25,375
I'm good to go, so wrap it
up whenever you're ready.

1262
01:04:25,375 --> 01:04:26,977
And that's easy to
listen to a message.

1263
01:04:26,977 --> 01:04:30,180
I can reply to it the same way.

1264
01:04:30,180 --> 01:04:31,381
Craig, it's good to hear

1265
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:33,984
that you survived the
great hair crisis of 2014.

I'll get things wrapped up here

1267

and we'll get the
show back to you.

1268

Lower it and the
message is sent.

1269

01:05:02,712 --> 01:05:09,352
OK. So next up, iCloud Drive.

1278
01:05:09,352 --> 01:05:12,288
So, of course, iCloud
documents work great

1279
01:05:12,288 --> 01:05:16,526
across a single app
on your iOS devices.

1280
01:05:16,526 --> 01:05:20,330
But now, with iCloud Drive,
you also have a great way

1281
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:22,899
to work across applications.

1282
01:05:22,899 --> 01:05:27,003
So say you're in an app here
like Sketchbook, you can bring

1283
01:05:27,003 --> 01:05:31,074
up your iCloud Drive panel
and open documents directly

1284
01:05:31,074 --> 01:05:32,375
from other applications

1285
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:35,245
like a compatible document
inside of GoodReader.

1286
01:05:35,245 --> 01:05:38,748
And when you open it up in that
document, in that application

1287
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:41,785
and edit it, those edits
are saved right back

1288
01:05:41,785 --> 01:05:43,086
to their original locations.

1289
01:05:43,086 --> 01:05:44,487
So you don't end up with all

1290
01:05:44,487 --> 01:05:47,123
of these different
versions and copy problems.

1291
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:50,693
Now, of course, you also have
access to all of those documents

1292
01:05:50,693 --> 01:05:53,830
on your Mac and on
Windows as well.

1293
01:05:53,830 --> 01:05:55,598
So that's iCloud Drive.

1294
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:59,102
Next up, something you weren't
expecting from me, Enterprise.

1295
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:02,205
Now it turns out that iOS--

1296
01:06:02,205 --> 01:06:05,375
yeah, they got one Enterprise
guy over there, I know.

1297
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:07,911
So iOS is a huge hit
in the Enterprise.

1298
01:06:07,911 --> 01:06:12,615
In fact, 98 percent of
the Fortune 500 uses iOS.

1299
01:06:12,615 --> 01:06:15,618
And we're going to
get the last two.

1300
01:06:15,618 --> 01:06:19,222
And it's in part
because of these great

1301
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:22,425
iOS-tailored applications.

1302
01:06:22,425 --> 01:06:27,564
But it's also because of the
amazing array of technologies,

1303
01:06:27,564 --> 01:06:29,766
both technologies that
applied to all of us

1304
01:06:29,766 --> 01:06:32,368
in protecting our
privacy and security

1305
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:34,771
but also Enterprise
manageability features

1306
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:37,373
that we've added to
iOS over the years.

1307
01:06:37,373 --> 01:06:40,009
Now, one of them
that we just released

1308
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:43,947
in the last few months I think
is emblematic of our philosophy

1309
01:06:43,947 --> 01:06:47,517
of the Enterprise, and that's
the Device Enrollment Program.

1310
01:06:47,517 --> 01:06:49,819
Now traditionally, if you
go to work at a company

1311
01:06:49,819 --> 01:06:51,921
and they want you to give you
a device, they actually have

1312
01:06:51,921 --> 01:06:55,125
to take the device they give
you, rip it out of its box,

1313
01:06:55,125 --> 01:06:58,261
connect it to some PC,
image it with software

1314
01:06:58,261 --> 01:07:00,430
to configure, it's a big pain.

1315
01:07:00,430 --> 01:07:02,665
But now with the Device
Enrollment Program,

1316
01:07:02,665 --> 01:07:05,068
you can actually get
your iPad or iPhone

1317
01:07:05,068 --> 01:07:07,303
in its original shrink wrap box.

1318
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:11,341
And when you open it up, it'll
automatically configure itself

1319
01:07:11,341 --> 01:07:13,776
for your Enterprise,
setting up all of your mail

1320
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:16,146
and getting your mail
messages, automatically setting

1321
01:07:16,146 --> 01:07:19,449
up your calendar, and even
downloading all your Enterprise

1322
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:21,985
apps, it's that simple.

1323
01:07:21,985 --> 01:07:26,623
Well now, in iOS 8, we
continue our focus on security,

1324
01:07:26,623 --> 01:07:28,725
productivity and management.

1325
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:31,127
iOS 8 has expanded
data protection.

1326
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,096
So you get passcode protection

1327
01:07:33,096 --> 01:07:36,633
of all the major data types
including third-party apps.

1328
01:07:36,633 --> 01:07:38,902
We have a Per-message S/MIME

1329
01:07:38,902 --> 01:07:41,371
and we have a great productivity
feature I think we're all going

1330
01:07:41,371 --> 01:07:43,873
to like called VIP threads.

1331
01:07:43,873 --> 01:07:46,809
So now, there's a thread
you're on or message you send,

1332
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:48,178
and you want to get notified

1333
01:07:48,178 --> 01:07:50,647
on the lock screen whenever
there's a reply on that thread,

1334
01:07:50,647 --> 01:07:53,082
you can get that
with just a tap.

in calendar.

1337
01:08:00,190 --> 01:08:04,194
And we support third-party
Enterprise document providers

01:08:04,194 --> 01:08:06,629
in addition to iCloud,
integrated right

1339
01:08:06,629 --> 01:08:09,499
in to iCloud capable
applications.

1340
01:08:09,499 --> 01:08:11,234
Now we also improved
our management--

1341
01:08:11,234 --> 01:08:13,236

1343
01:08:15,438 --> 01:08:18,841
So, we also extend
our management

1344
01:08:18,841 --> 01:08:20,577
to include managed
books and PDFs,

1345
01:08:20,577 --> 01:08:24,913
and this is of course especially
valuable for education.

1346

features for Enterprise.

vast array of healthcare devices

everything from monitoring
your activity level,

to your heart rate,
to your weight,

monitor all of your metrics

that you're most
interested in your activity.

1367

use third-party applications.

protect your privacy

which applications have access

to which part of your
healthcare information.

But you can for instance provide
different activity, weight,

heart rate information
to the Nike app.

1373
01:09:47,563 --> 01:09:49,932
And Nike is working to
integrate HealthKit,

1374
01:09:49,932 --> 01:09:52,368

to help you in your pursuit

innovators in healthcare.

1378
01:10:00,543 --> 01:10:03,346
And with their integration
with HealthKit, they're going

1379
01:10:03,346 --> 01:10:07,950
to be able that when a patient
takes let's say a blood pressure

1380
01:10:07,950 --> 01:10:11,354
reading, HealthKit
automatically notifies their app

1381
01:10:11,354 --> 01:10:13,856
and their app is automatically
able to check whether

1382
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:16,492
that reading is within
that patient's personalized

and thresholds.

1384
01:10:18,761 --> 01:10:22,165
And if not, it can contact
the hospital proactively,

notify a doctor and that
doctor can reach back

1386
01:10:25,068 --> 01:10:28,938
to that patient providing
more timely care.

Now we think this is going to be
really important for healthcare

1390
01:10:39,382 --> 01:10:42,118
and the CEO of the
Mayo Clinic agrees.

1391
01:10:42,118 --> 01:10:44,587
He says that, "We believe
Apple's HealthKit will

1392
01:10:44,587 --> 01:10:47,090
revolutionize the
health industry--

1393
01:10:47,090 --> 01:10:49,325
how the health industry
interacts with people.

We're proud to be
at the forefront

of this innovative technology
with the Mayo Clinic app."

1396
01:10:54,430 --> 01:10:57,633
We agree. Now we're also
working with leaders

1397
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:00,269
in healthcare applications
like Epic systems.

1398
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:05,308
Now they provide the technology
that enables hospitals serving

1399
01:11:05,308 --> 01:11:07,510
over 100 million Americans.

1400
01:11:07,510 --> 01:11:10,179
And so now with their
integration with HealthKit,

1401
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:13,583

institutions will be able

1402
01:11:13,583 --> 01:11:16,586
to get closer in
sharing their information

It's the easy way to
share what's important.

1407
01:11:35,872 --> 01:11:38,174
Now when I was a kid,

1408
01:11:38,174 --> 01:11:41,110
the refrigerator was the
center of family sharing.

like this except the
kid who had gray hair.

1411
01:11:44,914 --> 01:11:51,254
But we've now in iOS made it
that easy to set up your family

1412
01:11:51,254 --> 01:11:54,524
on their iOS devices and once
you've set up your family

1413
01:11:54,524 --> 01:11:57,593
as a family unit,
you automatically get

1414
01:11:57,593 --> 01:12:01,864
to share photos with the shared
photo stream, to share calendars

1415
01:12:01,864 --> 01:12:05,067
with your family, to
share reminder list

1416

because they can make
purchases on your credit card,

to all of your photos for your
consistent iCloud photo library

1448

but your device actually
has access to more photos

1449
01:14:02,118 --> 01:14:05,221
in the cloud than it can
physically store locally

all wherever you are.

you want great search and
so we now on iOS 8 Photos,

1453

we give you great search
suggestions for instance

1454

of locations, photos taken
near where you are right now,

photos taken in your home,

So here I am in my large
cloud photo collection,

1468
01:15:14,757 --> 01:15:18,461
and I have great search here,
so I have all my suggestion

1469
01:15:18,461 --> 01:15:21,597
but I can also start typing
and you notice I get matches

1470
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:23,866
on location and time period.

1471
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:26,502
But also an album, so here
I have beach day with Mandy.

1472
01:15:26,502 --> 01:15:28,671
And I can tap right in there,

1473
01:15:28,671 --> 01:15:32,074
look through these nice
photos, let's take a look.

1474
01:15:32,074 --> 01:15:33,976
Those are some good ones.

1475
01:15:33,976 --> 01:15:37,813
Now that's a photo that
I think has potential

1476
01:15:37,813 --> 01:15:40,716
but it's really quite dark
and kind of washed out.

1477
01:15:40,716 --> 01:15:42,952
Unfortunately, we have these
great smart editing controls

1478
01:15:42,952 --> 01:15:45,755
that I can use to fix it up, so
I'm going to bring up our levels

1479
01:15:45,755 --> 01:15:47,957
and you also have levels
for light and color

1480
01:15:47,957 --> 01:15:48,791
down there at the bottom.

1481
01:15:48,791 --> 01:15:49,825
I'm going tap on light,

1482
01:15:49,825 --> 01:15:53,229
and I get this great
smart light meter.

1483
01:15:53,229 --> 01:15:56,532
Now I can just drag this across
like this and it lightens

1484
01:15:56,532 --> 01:15:58,834
up the photo really nicely,

1485
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:00,970
so I dial that in
just the way I want.

1486
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:04,073
But what's happening under
the hood is really amazing.

1487
01:16:04,073 --> 01:16:06,876
You notice that to achieve
the lightning effect,

1488
01:16:06,876 --> 01:16:10,179
it brought brightness
and contrast up, exposure

1489
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:12,815
and highlights down
and shadows up based

1490
01:16:12,815 --> 01:16:16,052
on detailed image analysis of
what would achieve that effect.

1491
01:16:16,052 --> 01:16:18,254
Now I could go in and
I could manually try

1492
01:16:18,254 --> 01:16:21,257
to tweak those parameters like
have that level of control

1493
01:16:21,257 --> 01:16:23,859
but I don't need to because
it does such a great job

1494
01:16:23,859 --> 01:16:27,863
and I also have that control
for color, so I can just drive

1495
01:16:27,863 --> 01:16:31,967
up the color for instance, bring
out the sky and the skin tones

1496
01:16:31,967 --> 01:16:33,836
and I look at the difference
of what we've been able

it's really awesome.

that right now in favorites,
I don't have that picture

1506

because I didn't favorite it.

made those nice edits,

1508
01:17:04,633 --> 01:17:06,368
the picture is looking great,
I think I'll make it one

01:17:06,368 --> 01:17:09,438
of my favorites, I'll just tap
on my iPhone on a little heart

1531
01:18:37,226 --> 01:18:40,129
with the title bar,
it's really gorgeous.

1532
01:18:40,129 --> 01:18:45,234
I'm going to go ahead and browse
through these a little bit.

1533
01:18:47,136 --> 01:18:49,305
Now here's a photo
that looks really

1534
01:18:49,305 --> 01:18:50,406
like it's got some potential

1535
01:18:50,406 --> 01:18:53,108
but it could use
some brightening up,

1536
01:18:53,108 --> 01:18:55,744
can have the same
kinds of adjustments.

1537
01:18:55,744 --> 01:18:57,980
You notice here at this
light and color meters, well,

1538
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,983
I can just close this control,
so we can watch what happens

1539
01:19:00,983 --> 01:19:04,386
in real time as I make
the lighting adjustment.

1540
01:19:04,386 --> 01:19:06,655
And notice how some of these
are going up and some are going

1541
01:19:06,655 --> 01:19:10,826
down to create this
effect, it's really great.

1542
01:19:10,826 --> 01:19:15,564
I can do the same with color,
let's just boost the color,

1543
01:19:15,564 --> 01:19:21,103
bring out the sky, bring out the
skin tones, and it's that easy,

1544
01:19:21,103 --> 01:19:25,140
the new photos app, to really
create beautiful images.

1545
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:28,677
And that's a quick preview
of photos coming to Yosemite

1546
01:19:28,677 --> 01:19:31,981
in the future and to
the new photo solution

1547

get all your photos

in your organization crush
your iOS devices and soon

1551
01:19:50,299 --> 01:19:54,603
with your Mac and via
the web, Windows as well.

1552
01:19:54,603 --> 01:19:58,407
Now this is all your
photos and also your videos.

1553
01:19:58,407 --> 01:20:00,576
And these are in
their original format

1554
01:20:00,576 --> 01:20:03,379
and their full resolution.

1555
01:20:03,379 --> 01:20:05,648
Now this uses your
iCloud storage,

1556
01:20:05,648 --> 01:20:08,083
so your first 5 gigs are free.

1557
01:20:08,083 --> 01:20:11,020
And we have some great new
affordable plans coming,

1558

where you get 20 gigs for just
99 cents a month and 200 gigs

1559
01:20:16,025 --> 01:20:18,527
for 3.99, so we can all afford

1560
01:20:18,527 --> 01:20:21,730
to get all our photos
safely up in the cloud.

So, a great set of major
features coming to iOS.

1564
01:20:35,077 --> 01:20:38,480
But of course, there's
always a whole lot more

1565
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,616
than I have time
to talk about here.

1566
01:20:40,616 --> 01:20:44,954
I do want to hit on just two
more quickly, and one is Siri.

1567
01:20:44,954 --> 01:20:48,824
Now, we have-- if you take
your phone and you plug it

1568
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:51,727
in for instance in the car,
you can say, "Hey Siri,"

1569
01:20:51,727 --> 01:20:54,029
and start talking to
Siri without having

1570
01:20:54,029 --> 01:20:55,998
to even touch your phone.

1571
01:20:55,998 --> 01:20:58,701
And we have song
recognition with Shazam.

1572
01:20:58,701 --> 01:21:01,437
So now, if you just start up
Siri and there's a song playing

1573
01:21:01,437 --> 01:21:03,505
around you, it will
tell you what it is

1574
01:21:03,505 --> 01:21:07,443
and you can even purchase it
right there from within Siri.

1575
01:21:07,443 --> 01:21:10,446
Siri also now supports
streaming voice recognition.

1576
01:21:10,446 --> 01:21:12,581
So as you talk, you can
see what it's recognizing.

1577
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:15,617
It's more responsive than
ever, and we have support

1578
01:21:15,617 --> 01:21:19,688
for 22 new dictation languages.

1579
01:21:19,688 --> 01:21:23,726
Finally, in China we now
have greatly improved maps

1580
01:21:23,726 --> 01:21:27,830
with vector based maps and
turn by turn directions.

1581
01:21:27,830 --> 01:21:30,933
We also have support for
lunar calendar which is great

1582
01:21:30,933 --> 01:21:33,002
for holidays and birthdays.

1583
01:21:33,002 --> 01:21:38,674
Improved Chinese predictive
input and improved weather data.

So that's a look at the
consumer part of iOS 8.

1587
01:21:51,987 --> 01:21:53,589
To tell you the other
half of the story,

1588
01:21:53,589 --> 01:21:55,290
I'm going to hand
it back to Tim.

Amazing new features, and if we
ended the keynote now it would

1593
01:22:08,570 --> 01:22:10,939
be a giant release.

1594
01:22:10,939 --> 01:22:13,509
But there is a lot more.

1595
01:22:13,509 --> 01:22:18,414
The second part of the
story is what iOS 8 provides

1596
01:22:18,414 --> 01:22:20,215
for developers.

1597
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:24,753
And extending your capability to
make even more incredible apps

1598
01:22:24,753 --> 01:22:28,223
and apps you could
not create before.

1599
01:22:28,223 --> 01:22:34,396
Now, all of these apps are
delivered via the App Store.

1600
01:22:34,396 --> 01:22:40,335
The App Store now has over 1.2
million of your apps on it.

1601
01:22:40,335 --> 01:22:42,704
This is a phenomenal number.

1602
01:22:42,704 --> 01:22:48,210
And the marketplace around these
apps is unbelievably vibrant,

1603
01:22:48,210 --> 01:22:54,616
300,000,000 people visit
the App Store every week.

1604
01:22:54,616 --> 01:23:00,055
And these people aren't just
browsing, they are downloading.

1605
01:23:00,055 --> 01:23:05,060
They've now downloaded
over 75 billion apps.

1606
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:07,763
These are mind blowing numbers.

1607
01:23:07,763 --> 01:23:13,802
Now, what we want to do is
make the App Store even better.

1608
01:23:13,802 --> 01:23:16,872
And so, we're rolling out
a number of new features

1609
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:23,946
on the store, starting with
we're adding an Explore tab

1610

So you can browse through
categories and subcategories.

01:23:31,620 --> 01:23:33,755
We're adding top
trending searches

01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:35,824
to make search even better.

a continuous scrolling list.

first time today a new service,

them through the week

and in the afternoon sessions

1642
01:25:25,234 --> 01:25:29,805

a ton in the App Store.

It is a huge release.

Everything will be
available in the fall.

Now, that brings us to the SDK.

01:25:38,847 --> 01:25:41,984
And for those of you
that are not developers,

1647
01:25:41,984 --> 01:25:45,287
the SDK is a Software
Development Kit

1648

that enables developers to
make all of the amazing apps.

This release is the
biggest release

01:25:55,097 --> 01:25:58,333
since the launch
of the App Store.

1651
01:25:58,333 --> 01:26:02,371
And it will give developers
the capabilities and tools

01:26:02,371 --> 01:26:05,240
to make things that
you haven't dreamed of

of endurance training
thing Tim is doing to me.

1659
01:26:28,964 --> 01:26:34,002
So, with this year's SDK, the
team has done just an unreal job

with over 4,000 new
developer APIs.

Now, I want to start
with something

1662
01:26:40,375 --> 01:26:43,545
that I think is perhaps
most profound

1663
01:26:43,545 --> 01:26:46,181
and that's Extensibility.

1664
01:26:46,181 --> 01:26:48,617
So with Extensibility,
applications

1665
01:26:48,617 --> 01:26:52,487
from the App Store will be
able to extend the system

1666
01:26:52,487 --> 01:26:55,557
and offer services
to other apps.

Now of course, one

1669
01:27:06,401 --> 01:27:08,670
of the reasons we're also
comfortable installing

1670
01:27:08,670 --> 01:27:13,542
so many apps from the App
Store are iOS' security model.

1671
01:27:13,542 --> 01:27:16,111
Apps are isolated
inside of sandboxes

1672
01:27:16,111 --> 01:27:18,447
where they can access their
own data but can't get

1673
01:27:18,447 --> 01:27:21,149
at your personal information
or mess with other apps

1674
01:27:21,149 --> 01:27:22,818
without your permission.

1675
01:27:22,818 --> 01:27:26,621
Well, the handle
Extensibility in an iOS way,

1676
01:27:26,621 --> 01:27:29,591
we wanted to build on the
same sandboxing model.

1677
01:27:29,591 --> 01:27:33,428
So now extensions live inside
an application's own sandbox

1678
01:27:33,428 --> 01:27:36,865
with access to its own data,
but other applications can reach

1679
01:27:36,865 --> 01:27:40,836
out by way of iOS'
security mechanisms,

1680
01:27:40,836 --> 01:27:41,970
talk to that extension.

1681
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,773
That extension can even
project UI right back

1682
01:27:44,773 --> 01:27:46,575
in to the originating app.

1683
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:48,810
Now this enables
some great things.

1684
01:27:48,810 --> 01:27:50,178
For instance, in addition

1685
01:27:50,178 --> 01:27:52,647
to the systems built-in
sharing options,

1686
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:57,252
an app like Pinterest can
offer share sheet to Safari.

1687
01:27:57,252 --> 01:28:00,455
And if you look at
actions, for instance,

1688
01:28:00,455 --> 01:28:04,326
an app like Bing could offer
translation right inside

1689
01:28:04,326 --> 01:28:10,265
of Safari accessing the web
pages web content right there.

1690
01:28:10,265 --> 01:28:14,603
Now we're also supporting photo
filters inside the photos,

1691
01:28:14,603 --> 01:28:16,304
and enabling third parties

1692
01:28:16,304 --> 01:28:19,207
to define their own
document providers that work

1693
01:28:19,207 --> 01:28:23,145
within the iCloud
drive-enabled application.

1694
01:28:23,145 --> 01:28:28,283
Finally, we're enabling third
party apps to define widgets

1695
01:28:28,283 --> 01:28:31,520

1698
01:28:42,364 --> 01:28:45,867
So let's start with
photo filters.

1699
01:28:45,867 --> 01:28:47,402
So, we're back here in photos

1700
01:28:47,402 --> 01:28:51,039
and I've got a nice
photo here of a flower.

1701
01:28:51,039 --> 01:28:53,909
And I'm going to go ahead and
edit and you notice an addition

1702
01:28:53,909 --> 01:28:56,311
to the options here at
the bottom of the screen,

1703
01:28:56,311 --> 01:28:59,114
we have at the top left
this extensions button.

1704
01:28:59,114 --> 01:29:01,516
I'm going to click
that, tap that rather.

1705
01:29:01,516 --> 01:29:04,219
And you notice I have
several extensions available,

1706
01:29:04,219 --> 01:29:06,721
one from VSCO Cam and
one from Waterlogue.

1707
01:29:06,721 --> 01:29:08,490
I'm going to select Waterlogue.

1708
01:29:08,490 --> 01:29:11,526
And now the Waterlogue extension
is able to run right here

1709
01:29:11,526 --> 01:29:15,130
in the context of photos to
manipulate my photo bringing

1710
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:21,269
up their own UI, deliver this
beautiful water color effect

1711
01:29:21,269 --> 01:29:26,141
to my photo, and when I'm
done, it's right back inside

1712
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:28,510
of my photo album,
it's that easy.

1713
01:29:28,510 --> 01:29:34,349
[ Applause ]

1714
01:29:34,349 --> 01:29:36,017
Then next let's take
a look at widgets.

1715
01:29:36,017 --> 01:29:39,054
So I'm going to just pull
down Notification Center.

1716
01:29:39,054 --> 01:29:42,557
I have my existing widgets
here in my Today view.

1717
01:29:42,557 --> 01:29:45,126
Did you notice an addition
to my widget is down here

1718
01:29:45,126 --> 01:29:47,162
at the bottom it says
"One New Widget Available"

1719
01:29:47,162 --> 01:29:48,964
because I've downloaded
an app recently

1720
01:29:48,964 --> 01:29:51,700
that contains a Notification
Center widget.

1721
01:29:51,700 --> 01:29:52,601
So I'm going to tap Edit.

1722
01:29:52,601 --> 01:29:54,703
And you notice its SportsCenter.

1723
01:29:54,703 --> 01:29:57,205
So I can tap the plus
next to SportsCenter,

1724
01:29:57,205 --> 01:30:00,942
position it where I want, I'm
on my widgets in my Today view.

1725
01:30:00,942 --> 01:30:03,144
Tap Done, and now
I have information

1726
01:30:03,144 --> 01:30:06,581
on my favorite sports
teams right here inside

1727
01:30:06,581 --> 01:30:08,350
of Notification Center.

1728
01:30:08,350 --> 01:30:11,186
Now this works great
on iPad as well.

1729
01:30:11,186 --> 01:30:14,022
Let's take a look at iPad.

1730
01:30:14,022 --> 01:30:17,192
So iPad, I'm going to bring
down Notification Center.

1731
01:30:17,192 --> 01:30:20,695
And you notice I have this
interactive widget from eBay.

1732
01:30:20,695 --> 01:30:26,101
So, I'm bidding on a guitar and
apparently I'm being outbid.

1733
01:30:26,101 --> 01:30:28,436
So I can now write inside of
notification, take advantage

1734
01:30:28,436 --> 01:30:30,138
of the interactivity widgets.

1735
01:30:30,138 --> 01:30:34,109
I can tap and bid
and just like this,

1736
01:30:34,109 --> 01:30:39,281
I can submit a leading bid all
inside of Notification Center.

1737
01:30:39,281 --> 01:30:42,017
Now to wrap it up, I want to
show you extensions in Safari.

1738
01:30:42,017 --> 01:30:44,119
I'm going to bring up Safari.

1739
01:30:44,119 --> 01:30:45,554
Use our great new tab view.

1740
01:30:45,554 --> 01:30:49,190
It's a page I've been looking
at here with some information

1741
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:52,594
on a beautiful guitar and I'd
like to learn more about it but,

1742
01:30:52,594 --> 01:30:56,031
unfortunately, you notice
the text here is in Japanese

1743
01:30:56,031 --> 01:30:58,266
and I do not read Japanese.

1744
01:30:58,266 --> 01:31:01,136
Fortunately, I have a Bing
translation extension,

1745
01:31:01,136 --> 01:31:05,373
so I can just bring
up my action sheet.

1746
01:31:05,373 --> 01:31:07,876
And you notice down here in
the second row, Bing translate,

1747
01:31:07,876 --> 01:31:10,579
I'm going to tap on
that and Bing is able

1748
01:31:10,579 --> 01:31:14,316
to translate this web
page right in line.

1749
01:31:14,316 --> 01:31:15,550
Look at that.

1750
01:31:15,550 --> 01:31:22,624
[ Applause ]

1751
01:31:22,624 --> 01:31:24,459
Now for our extension's
grand finale,

1752
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:27,462
let's put that on
my Pinterest board.

1753
01:31:27,462 --> 01:31:29,331
You see Pinterest has
an extension right here.

1754
01:31:29,331 --> 01:31:32,767
I'm going to tap on that and
this is actually able to bring

1755
01:31:32,767 --> 01:31:35,837
up a UI defined by Pinterest
where I can select my board,

1756
01:31:35,837 --> 01:31:37,205
maybe select my guitar's board.

1757
01:31:37,205 --> 01:31:39,407
Now the Pinterest
extension is accessed

1758
01:31:39,407 --> 01:31:41,977
to the underlying
web page, so I can--

1759
01:31:41,977 --> 01:31:43,812
let me slide through
the different photos

1760
01:31:43,812 --> 01:31:46,548
on the page till I find
the one I want to share.

1761
01:31:46,548 --> 01:31:47,515
That's it.

1762
01:31:47,515 --> 01:31:49,718
Tap and I pinned it.

1763
01:31:49,718 --> 01:31:53,588
And that's a quick look
at extensions in iOS 8.

1764
01:31:53,588 --> 01:32:00,462
[ Applause ]

1765
01:32:00,462 --> 01:32:03,832
Now there's one important kind
of extension that I did fail

1766
01:32:03,832 --> 01:32:06,001
to mention and that's
the ability

1767
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:10,538
to install system-wide
third party keyboards.

1768
01:32:10,538 --> 01:32:16,444
[ Applause ]

1769
01:32:16,444 --> 01:32:18,680
So now if you have special
keyboard you want to use,

1770
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:20,415
you can install those in iOS.

1771
01:32:20,415 --> 01:32:23,351
And by default, those
of course run inside

1772
01:32:23,351 --> 01:32:26,655
of the most restrictive
sandbox with no network access

1773
01:32:26,655 --> 01:32:29,224
because we want to make sure
to protect your privacy.

1774
01:32:29,224 --> 01:32:33,128
But if that keyboard requires
or you want to grant it ability,

1775
01:32:33,128 --> 01:32:35,797
it can ask for access
to the network

1776
01:32:35,797 --> 01:32:38,166
to provide extended
functionality.

1777
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:40,802
We put those controls
in your hands.

1778
01:32:40,802 --> 01:32:44,572
That's extensions on iOS 8.

[ Applause ]

1782
01:32:58,119 --> 01:33:02,824
From the moment we
introduced Touch ID,

1783
01:33:02,824 --> 01:33:05,660
developers were excited
about the potential

1784
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:07,429
and there's no question why,

1785
01:33:07,429 --> 01:33:10,899
Touch ID has been
extremely popular

1786
01:33:10,899 --> 01:33:12,734
and people authenticating
in their devices.

1787
01:33:12,734 --> 01:33:14,703
If you look at passcode usage

1788
01:33:14,703 --> 01:33:17,806
on iOS before Touch
ID was less than half.

1789
01:33:17,806 --> 01:33:23,178
On iPhone 5s 83 percent,
people love using Touch ID.

1790
01:33:23,178 --> 01:33:26,114
And now, third party
apps can take advantage

1791
01:33:26,114 --> 01:33:28,550
of Touch ID as well.

1792
01:33:28,550 --> 01:33:36,424
[ Applause ]

1793
01:33:36,424 --> 01:33:39,227
So Touch ID protects logins
and user data and it works

1794
01:33:39,227 --> 01:33:41,663
by unlocking Keychain items.

1795
01:33:41,663 --> 01:33:44,666
So it identifies successful
fingerprint matches

1796
01:33:44,666 --> 01:33:47,769
but it always keeps the
fingerprint data itself

1797
01:33:47,769 --> 01:33:49,571
completely protected inside

1798
01:33:49,571 --> 01:33:53,074
of the Secure Enclave
in the A7 processor.

1799
01:33:53,074 --> 01:33:55,176
The fingerprint information
is never exposed

1800
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:58,079
to third party apps or the rest
of the system for that matter.

1801
01:33:58,079 --> 01:34:00,148
It's very secure.

1802
01:34:00,148 --> 01:34:01,282
That's Touch ID.

1803
01:34:01,282 --> 01:34:03,518
Then next, Cameras.

1804
01:34:03,518 --> 01:34:08,690
We're providing Camera APIs
from manual control of exposure,

1805

white balance and focus.

1806
01:34:10,992 --> 01:34:15,330
And we've enhanced the PhotoKit

the ability not just to
read but also to write

1808
01:34:17,465 --> 01:34:20,401
to the photo library and this
is now your cloud photo library

It's really great.

1811

Now, we talked about
the great HealthKit API,

1812
01:34:27,142 --> 01:34:31,546
but now we'd also have HomeKit.

1814
01:34:38,953 --> 01:34:42,323
Now, there are a lot of great
home automation devices coming

1815
01:34:42,323 --> 01:34:44,559
on the market these days and
they have companion apps,

1816
01:34:44,559 --> 01:34:48,930
things like lights and
door locks, webcams,

1817
01:34:48,930 --> 01:34:52,400
garage doors, and thermostats.

1818
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,069
But, you know, each of them
have their own application

1819
01:34:55,069 --> 01:34:59,007
and they end up defining
their own network protocol,

1820
01:34:59,007 --> 01:35:01,476
their own security mechanisms.

1821
01:35:01,476 --> 01:35:05,113
Well, we thought we could bring
some rationality to the space.

1822
01:35:05,113 --> 01:35:07,816
We started working
with the leaders

1823
01:35:07,816 --> 01:35:10,285
in home automation devices.

1824
01:35:10,285 --> 01:35:15,123
And we've come up with HomeKit
with a common network protocol

1825
01:35:15,123 --> 01:35:17,425
that has secure pairing
to ensure

1826
01:35:17,425 --> 01:35:20,762
that only your iPhone
can open your garage door

1827
01:35:20,762 --> 01:35:22,630
or unlock your door.

1828
01:35:22,630 --> 01:35:25,767
And in addition to being able
to control individual devices

1829
01:35:25,767 --> 01:35:29,504
in your home, with HomeKit you
can group devices and changes

1830
01:35:29,504 --> 01:35:33,141
in the scenes and then with
Siri integration you can say

1831
01:35:33,141 --> 01:35:35,710
something like, "Get ready
for bed," and be assured

1832
01:35:35,710 --> 01:35:38,379
that your garage door is
closed, your door is locked,

1833
01:35:38,379 --> 01:35:39,681
the thermostat is lower,

Next, CloudKit.

1837
01:35:53,928 --> 01:35:55,830
So today, if you're a developer

1838
01:35:55,830 --> 01:35:57,532
and you're writing
an application

1839
01:35:57,532 --> 01:36:00,635
and it needs a web component,
well, you end up really having

1840
01:36:00,635 --> 01:36:02,637
to write two apps in one.

1841
01:36:02,637 --> 01:36:05,506
In addition to the writing in
the client side using Xcode

1842
01:36:05,506 --> 01:36:06,841
and our frameworks, you have

1843
01:36:06,841 --> 01:36:08,209
to write the server
side of the app.

1844
01:36:08,209 --> 01:36:11,813
You have to write server side
app logic, you have to deal

1845
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:14,649
with authentication, asset
storage, database storage,

1846
01:36:14,649 --> 01:36:17,018
search, even push
notifications and then you got

1847
01:36:17,018 --> 01:36:19,287
to pay somebody to host it all.

1848
01:36:19,287 --> 01:36:23,091
Well, now, with CloudKit,
CloudKit takes

1849
01:36:23,091 --> 01:36:25,760
over the cloud part
and provide you

1850
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:28,363
with a client side
programming model

1851
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:32,567
that lets you access iCloud
authentication storage,

1852
01:36:32,567 --> 01:36:34,535
search and more.

1853
01:36:34,535 --> 01:36:36,871
And when it comes to paying,

1854
01:36:36,871 --> 01:36:45,747
CloudKit is effectively
free, with limits.

1855
01:36:45,747 --> 01:36:49,651
So, CloudKit scales the
data allocated to your app

1856
01:36:49,651 --> 01:36:53,288
and bandwidth based on the
number of users using your app.

1857
01:36:53,288 --> 01:36:56,958
And this goes all the way up
to granting you free a petabyte

1858
01:36:56,958 --> 01:36:59,427
of assets, 10 terabytes
of database

1859
01:36:59,427 --> 01:37:02,931
and all the bandwidth you
can constructively use.

1860
01:37:02,931 --> 01:37:05,500

01:37:29,357 --> 01:37:33,494
for high performance 3D graphics
on iOS, giving you access

1867
01:37:33,494 --> 01:37:37,031
to the power of the
A7 processor.

1868
01:37:37,031 --> 01:37:39,500
But increasingly, if you look at
what goes on in the performance

1869
01:37:39,500 --> 01:37:42,470
of the game, in addition to what
the game wants to accomplish,

1870
01:37:42,470 --> 01:37:46,474
OpenGL ends up being a
thick layer of overhead

1871
01:37:46,474 --> 01:37:49,777
between the game
and the hardware.

1872
01:37:49,777 --> 01:37:51,412
Well, now, we have Metal.

1873
01:37:51,412 --> 01:37:54,015
And Metal dramatically reduces

1874
01:37:54,015 --> 01:37:56,684
that overhead giving
the game near bare

1875
01:37:56,684 --> 01:37:59,988
to the metal access
to the power of A7.

1876
01:37:59,988 --> 01:38:05,727
The results are stunning up
to 10x faster draw call rates.

1877
01:38:05,727 --> 01:38:11,466
Now, in addition to these
dramatically reduced overheads,

1878
01:38:11,466 --> 01:38:13,234
you get access not
just to graphics

1879
01:38:13,234 --> 01:38:16,204
but to the compute
power of the GPU,

1880
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:18,539
and Metal supports
pre-compiled shaders

1881
01:38:18,539 --> 01:38:19,941
and efficient multithreading

1882
01:38:19,941 --> 01:38:23,111
so you can always get the
most out of the processor.

1883
01:38:23,111 --> 01:38:26,514
Now, we've been working
with the leading providers

1884
01:38:26,514 --> 01:38:30,651
of gaming engines
on mobile platforms

1885
01:38:30,651 --> 01:38:33,154
and what they've been able
to accomplish with Metal

1886
01:38:33,154 --> 01:38:37,191
in just a few weeks
is truly stunning.

1887
01:38:37,191 --> 01:38:39,961
Let's start with EA and the
work they've done taking their

1888
01:38:39,961 --> 01:38:47,502
console level title Plants vs.
Zombies and bringing it to iOS.

1889
01:38:47,502 --> 01:38:52,240
They're able to put over 1.3
million triangles on the screen

1890
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:55,476
at a time and do depth
of motion, effects,

1891
01:38:55,476 --> 01:38:58,713
depth of field effects that they
could never imagine achieving.

1892
01:38:58,713 --> 01:39:02,150
In fact, they're using their
Frostbyte console engine

1893
01:39:02,150 --> 01:39:05,920
that they thought could never
come to mobile and now it can.

1894
01:39:05,920 --> 01:39:08,523
And let's look at Crytek.

1895
01:39:08,523 --> 01:39:13,728
Crytek was able to bring their
console-level geom cache to iOS

1896
01:39:13,728 --> 01:39:14,862
and they were able to get

1897
01:39:14,862 --> 01:39:18,533
up to 4000 draw calls
per frame going here.

1898
01:39:18,533 --> 01:39:20,468
This is up to 10x, the kind

1899
01:39:20,468 --> 01:39:23,704
of performance they
were seeing previously.

1900
01:39:23,704 --> 01:39:29,277
Now, to show you live what
can be done with Metal,

1901
01:39:29,277 --> 01:39:32,346
I'd like to bring up the
founder of Epic Games

1902
01:39:32,346 --> 01:39:34,715
to the stage, Tim Sweeney.

1903
01:39:34,715 --> 01:39:37,518
Tim, come on up.

1904
01:39:37,518 --> 01:39:44,692
[ Applause ]

1905
01:39:44,692 --> 01:39:46,260
Thank you.

1906
01:39:46,260 --> 01:39:48,463
We've had the opportunity
to work with Metal

1907
01:39:48,463 --> 01:39:50,298
and to illustrate some
of the possibilities,

1908
01:39:50,298 --> 01:39:52,633
we created a Zen Garden.

1909
01:39:52,633 --> 01:39:56,337
Now this environment was built

1910
01:39:56,337 --> 01:39:58,673
in Unreal Engine 4
on a high-end Mac.

1911
01:39:58,673 --> 01:40:02,543
And now thanks to Metal, we're
running it on iPad in Realtime

1912
01:40:02,543 --> 01:40:05,480
with full fidelity
and performance.

1913
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,549
Metal's efficiency enable us
an order of magnitude increase

1914
01:40:08,549 --> 01:40:11,486
in detail making it possible
for developers like us

1915
01:40:11,486 --> 01:40:13,621
to create a new generation
of vivid

1916
01:40:13,621 --> 01:40:16,190
and interactive 3D experiences.

1917
01:40:16,190 --> 01:40:18,159
Now Josh Adams is the
programmer who wrote much

1918
01:40:18,159 --> 01:40:19,527
of the code that's running.

1919
01:40:19,527 --> 01:40:21,496
Josh, can you explain
what we're seeing here?

1920
01:40:21,496 --> 01:40:22,864
Yeah, sure.

1921
01:40:22,864 --> 01:40:25,633
First of all thanks to Metal
support for precompiled shaders,

1922
01:40:25,633 --> 01:40:27,168
we can have a huge
variety of materials

1923
01:40:27,168 --> 01:40:28,369
without a load time impact.

1924
01:40:28,369 --> 01:40:31,672
And our first stop we'll
check out this cherry tree

1925
01:40:31,672 --> 01:40:34,075
where I can drag on the
screen to paint the petals

1926
01:40:34,075 --> 01:40:36,777
on to the tree and they
start falling to the ground.

1927
01:40:36,777 --> 01:40:40,214
There are about 5,000 petals
here being physically simulated

1928
01:40:40,214 --> 01:40:41,983
and I can interact with them
by touching on the screen

1929
01:40:41,983 --> 01:40:43,117
to blow wind through the area.

1930
01:40:43,117 --> 01:40:48,923
All right, next up we
have a Koi pond filled

1931
01:40:48,923 --> 01:40:50,558
with hundreds of fish.

1932
01:40:50,558 --> 01:40:53,261
Metal has freed up enough
CPU time and we can have each

1933
01:40:53,261 --> 01:40:55,129
of them running their own
artificial intelligence

1934
01:40:55,129 --> 01:40:56,931
which you can see here as
I drag around the water.

1935
01:40:56,931 --> 01:40:59,834
And there's a few more fish
here than a real Koi pond

1936
01:40:59,834 --> 01:41:02,336
but since Metal lets us
do it, we figured why not.

1937
01:41:03,604 --> 01:41:06,407
And of course every Zen garden
needs some sand to rake.

1938
01:41:06,407 --> 01:41:09,410
So I go over here I can
rake any pattern I want

1939
01:41:09,410 --> 01:41:11,179
into the sand here.

1940
01:41:11,179 --> 01:41:13,681
Now artist love that they
can make an effect like this

1941
01:41:13,681 --> 01:41:15,249
without needing a
programmer like me to make

1942
01:41:15,249 --> 01:41:17,585
that one-off effect for
a drop core reduction

1943
01:41:17,585 --> 01:41:19,620
or other optimizations.

1944
01:41:22,823 --> 01:41:25,326
And for our final
moment of Zen walk

1945
01:41:25,326 --> 01:41:27,061
over to this water fountain.

1946
01:41:28,429 --> 01:41:32,233
Now I can tap on it, pour out
some water which then turns

1947
01:41:32,233 --> 01:41:34,168
to a couple hundred butterflies

1948
01:41:34,168 --> 01:41:36,604
but of course not
going to stop there.

1949
01:41:36,604 --> 01:41:38,606
So I can touch the screen
to call more of them to me

1950
01:41:38,606 --> 01:41:39,740
and then guide them
around the area.

1951
01:41:39,740 --> 01:41:43,744
So there are about 3,500
individually animated

1952
01:41:43,744 --> 01:41:45,146
and rendered butterfly
meshes here.

1953
01:41:45,146 --> 01:41:47,715
Now I had to keep telling the
artist to turn the numbers up

1954
01:41:47,715 --> 01:41:50,084
and up because they do not think
it was going to be possible.

1955
01:41:50,084 --> 01:41:51,586
Pretty cool huh?

1956
01:41:51,586 --> 01:42:00,595
[ Applause ]

1957
01:42:03,931 --> 01:42:05,333
Thanks.

1958
01:42:05,333 --> 01:42:07,168
There are thousands of objects
being rendered here and it seem

1959
01:42:07,168 --> 01:42:09,370
that we couldn't have
dreamed of building prior

1960
01:42:09,370 --> 01:42:11,672
to Metal delivering
a tenfold increase

1961
01:42:11,672 --> 01:42:12,940
in rendering efficiency.

1962
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:16,244
To have this level of
graphics capability on iPhone

1963
01:42:16,244 --> 01:42:18,913
and iPad now is a
stunning breakthrough.

1964
01:42:18,913 --> 01:42:22,950
We're proud to have been a part
of it and of course we'd love

1965
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,185
to share this with you.

1966
01:42:24,185 --> 01:42:26,621
So as soon as iOS 8 is
available we will be making

1967
01:42:26,621 --> 01:42:29,890
that Zen garden available
in the app store for free.

it's easy to forget on an iPad.

01:42:45,273 --> 01:42:47,375
Its incredible graphics
they were able to achieve

1972
01:42:47,375 --> 01:42:49,610
and I think we are all
feeling very Zen now.

1973
01:42:49,610 --> 01:42:50,845
So that's very good.

1974
01:42:50,845 --> 01:42:52,046
So that's Metal.

1975
01:42:52,046 --> 01:42:55,283
Now I want to move
from high-end 3D gaming

1976
01:42:55,283 --> 01:42:58,219
to casual gaming in Sprite Kit.

1977
01:42:58,219 --> 01:43:00,488
We introduced Sprite
Kit last year at WWDC.

1978
01:43:00,488 --> 01:43:02,890
And it's been a big hit

1979
01:43:02,890 --> 01:43:06,193
with people building casual
games on the app store.

1980
01:43:06,193 --> 01:43:09,130
And now this year we've
really enhanced Sprite Kit

1981
01:43:09,130 --> 01:43:11,365
with some things that make
your casual games just

1982
01:43:11,365 --> 01:43:12,767
that much more fun.

1983
01:43:12,767 --> 01:43:16,737
We have support for light
sources, field forces,

1984
01:43:16,737 --> 01:43:19,340
per-pixel physics that
actually allow your objects

1985
01:43:19,340 --> 01:43:22,043
to automatically interact
with proper physics based

1986
01:43:22,043 --> 01:43:26,380
on their drawn shapes and
even inverse kinematics.

1987
01:43:26,380 --> 01:43:28,916
And now also this year
for the first time

1988
01:43:28,916 --> 01:43:33,554
on iOS we're bringing SceneKit.

[ Applause ]

1990
01:43:37,058 --> 01:43:39,760
Now SceneKit is a
3D scene renderer

1991
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,563
and now it's been enhanced
as designed for casual games

1992
01:43:42,563 --> 01:43:45,766
with an integrated physics
engine, particle systems

1993
01:43:45,766 --> 01:43:48,502
and support for scripted
actions.

1994
01:43:48,502 --> 01:43:52,773
So these are two great solutions
for casual games on iOS.

1995
01:43:52,773 --> 01:43:56,577

1997
01:43:59,213 --> 01:44:02,183
Now Xcode is the tool set we use

1998
01:44:02,183 --> 01:44:06,687
to build all applications
for the Mac and iOS.

1999
01:44:06,687 --> 01:44:08,189
And Xcode is in fact one

2000
01:44:08,189 --> 01:44:11,659
of the most popular
pro-apps on our platform.

2001
01:44:11,659 --> 01:44:16,831
The last version was
downloaded 14 million times.

2002
01:44:16,831 --> 01:44:18,466
It's unbelievable.

2003
01:44:18,466 --> 01:44:22,803
Now of course central to
Xcode is the language we use

2004
01:44:22,803 --> 01:44:26,507
to develop our apps,
Objective-C.

2005
01:44:26,507 --> 01:44:30,978
Now Objective-C has served
us so well for 20 years.

2006
01:44:30,978 --> 01:44:32,346
We absolutely love it.

2007
01:44:32,346 --> 01:44:35,649
But we had to ask ourselves
the question what would it be

2008
01:44:35,649 --> 01:44:41,555
like if we had Objective-C
without the baggage of C?

than think about it.

language.

2013

and it totally rules [laughter].

2014

Swift is fast.

2015
01:45:07,848 --> 01:45:09,150
It is modern.

2016
01:45:09,150 --> 01:45:10,651
It is designed for safety.

2017
01:45:10,651 --> 01:45:13,287
And it enables the level of
interactivity and development

2018
01:45:13,287 --> 01:45:15,923
that you've never
seen on the platform.

2019
01:45:15,923 --> 01:45:19,894
When it comes to
speed, Swift is great.

2020
01:45:19,894 --> 01:45:21,929
Compare Python a popular
scripting language

2021
01:45:21,929 --> 01:45:23,831
with Objective-C, when it
comes to something like,

2022
01:45:23,831 --> 01:45:25,699
let's say complex object sort.

2023
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:28,536
Objective-C is a lot faster.

2024
01:45:28,536 --> 01:45:30,738
But Swift is faster still.

2025
01:45:30,738 --> 01:45:33,874
And take something like
RC4 encryption extremely

2026
01:45:33,874 --> 01:45:36,877
computationally intensive.

2027
01:45:36,877 --> 01:45:40,114
Python gets utterly crushed
in this particular benchmark.

And Objective-- but
look at Swift.

Now Swift is also modern
with features like Closures,

[ Laughter ]

2036
01:46:14,782 --> 01:46:17,651
With Swift you're able to
reduce a common pattern

2037
01:46:17,651 --> 01:46:20,421
that you might see in your
Objective-C code like this.

2038
01:46:20,421 --> 01:46:24,158
And reduce it to
something as simple as this.

2039
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:27,695
And Swift defines
away large classes

2040
01:46:27,695 --> 01:46:32,399
of common programming errors
they just aren't possible.

2041
01:46:32,399 --> 01:46:36,871
Now, Swift is completely native
to Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

2042
01:46:36,871 --> 01:46:39,640
It's built with the
same LLVM compiler

2043
01:46:39,640 --> 01:46:43,210
as Objective-C using the same
Optimizer and Autovectorizer.

2044
01:46:43,210 --> 01:46:45,946
And it has the same ARC
memory management model.

2045
01:46:45,946 --> 01:46:48,382
And the same runtime which means

2046
01:46:48,382 --> 01:46:53,087
that your Swift code can fit
right alongside your Objective-C

2047
01:46:53,087 --> 01:46:56,557
and your C code in
the same application.

[ Applause ]

2049
01:47:06,901 --> 01:47:09,537
Now Swift also enables a level
dynamism and interactivity

2050
01:47:09,537 --> 01:47:11,539
in development that
we've never seen before

2051
01:47:11,539 --> 01:47:14,508
for the feature we
call playgrounds.

2052
01:47:14,508 --> 01:47:17,912
To demonstrate Swift and
playgrounds in action,

2053
01:47:17,912 --> 01:47:21,448
I'd like to bring to
the stage Chris Lattner.

2054
01:47:21,448 --> 01:47:23,517
Come on up Chris.

2055
01:47:23,517 --> 01:47:29,356
[ Applause ]

2056
01:47:29,356 --> 01:47:30,558
Thank you Craig.

2057
01:47:30,558 --> 01:47:32,860
I am thrilled to be here
and to be the first person

2058
01:47:32,860 --> 01:47:35,863
to give you a taste of Swift.

2059
01:47:35,863 --> 01:47:36,964
Let me show you how fun

2060
01:47:36,964 --> 01:47:40,601
and interactive it is
to write Swift code.

2061
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:45,673
This is the Swift playground,

2062
01:47:45,673 --> 01:47:49,743
as I start typing I get
an immediately response.

2063
01:47:49,743 --> 01:47:52,379
It is actually running
my code as I type it

2064
01:47:52,379 --> 01:47:59,386
and displaying the result
in the sidebar to the right.

2065
01:47:59,386 --> 01:48:01,488
Of course, Swift
user type inference

2066
01:48:01,488 --> 01:48:04,491
and has powerful string
processing capabilities

2067
01:48:04,491 --> 01:48:06,860
which make it as easy to
use as a scripting language

2068
01:48:06,860 --> 01:48:10,297
without sacrificing
any performance.

2069
01:48:10,297 --> 01:48:13,133
Swift was designed from
the ground up for Cocoa

2070
01:48:13,133 --> 01:48:16,503
and Cocoa Touch, so of course
I have their full power

2071
01:48:16,503 --> 01:48:18,238
at my fingertips.

2072
01:48:18,238 --> 01:48:21,408
Now, I can build
anything with Swift

2073
01:48:21,408 --> 01:48:23,844
from a social media
application all the way

2074
01:48:23,844 --> 01:48:27,848
up to a high-performance,
3D game using Metal.

2075
01:48:27,848 --> 01:48:29,450
But today to keep it simple,

2076
01:48:29,450 --> 01:48:33,854
I think I'll write a
simple casual 2D game.

2077
01:48:33,854 --> 01:48:37,224
Let's start by using NSImage.

2078
01:48:37,224 --> 01:48:40,995
Let's start by using
NSImage to load a resource.

2079
01:48:40,995 --> 01:48:45,666
As you can see here, I've--

2080
01:48:45,666 --> 01:48:47,801
the playground sees
I've loaded an image,

2081
01:48:47,801 --> 01:48:52,206
I can ever see it right
here from within Xcode.

2082
01:48:52,206 --> 01:48:55,576
Now, Swift is loaded with
high-end features like Generics

2083
01:48:55,576 --> 01:48:59,580
that allow me to get a lot
done with very little code.

2084
01:48:59,580 --> 01:49:01,749
Here you can see I'm
using an array of strings

2085
01:49:01,749 --> 01:49:05,419
and using the functional map
algorithm to apply closure

2086
01:49:05,419 --> 01:49:08,722
to every element which allows
me to load an entire list

2087
01:49:08,722 --> 01:49:13,494
of images all with the
simple line of code.

2088
01:49:13,494 --> 01:49:16,163
Now, all these resources of part
of this game that I'm working on

2089
01:49:16,163 --> 01:49:21,101
and one piece I still need to
finish up is the flight path

2090
01:49:21,101 --> 01:49:23,937
for the blimp that we have.

2091
01:49:23,937 --> 01:49:26,907
Now this is a simple loop
that computes the position

2092
01:49:26,907 --> 01:49:30,411
for the blimp overtime
as my game plays.

2093
01:49:30,411 --> 01:49:34,448
And in addition to seeing
individual values Swift

2094
01:49:34,448 --> 01:49:37,518
playgrounds even allow me to
visualize the entire history

2095
01:49:37,518 --> 01:49:41,055
of a value overtime as
my application runs.

2096
01:49:41,055 --> 01:49:42,690
And so now I can immediately see

2097
01:49:42,690 --> 01:49:45,926
that this equation will
cause my blimp to slowly sink

2098
01:49:45,926 --> 01:49:48,429
as the scene plays out.

2099
01:49:48,429 --> 01:49:49,563
But I think I can do better

2100
01:49:49,563 --> 01:49:51,532
and that's not exactly
what I'm looking for.

2101
01:49:51,532 --> 01:49:56,670
So I can change the code and
I get an immediate response.

2102
01:49:56,670 --> 01:49:59,973
Simply by changing the equation
the blimp will now rise and fall

2103
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:02,042
as the scene plays out
which is a lot more

2104
01:50:02,042 --> 01:50:04,211
of what I'm looking for.

2105
01:50:04,211 --> 01:50:06,413
So, now that we have this the
way we want, we can take this

2106
01:50:06,413 --> 01:50:10,651
and copy it and let's go to
the game that I'm working on.

2107
01:50:10,651 --> 01:50:12,853
It's right here.

2108
01:50:12,853 --> 01:50:15,322
Now, this is a playground
just like before.

2109
01:50:15,322 --> 01:50:19,560
But here, I have a game in the
code written using Sprite Kit.

2110
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,830
Now, you can see our blimp
going left and right,

2111
01:50:22,830 --> 01:50:24,732
straight across the scene.

2112
01:50:24,732 --> 01:50:25,966
And, I can try out
the flight path

2113
01:50:25,966 --> 01:50:29,002
that we just developed
simply by pasting it in

2114
01:50:29,002 --> 01:50:32,005
and getting the immediate
feedback I'm looking for.

2115
01:50:32,005 --> 01:50:37,344
Now, the blimp is rising and
falling just like I wanted.

2116
01:50:37,344 --> 01:50:40,814
Because Swift enables
such powerful interactive

2117
01:50:40,814 --> 01:50:43,350
and dynamic programming
experiences,

2118
01:50:43,350 --> 01:50:46,987
it makes it really easy
to try out new things.

2119
01:50:46,987 --> 01:50:48,655
And, just by adding
a few lines of code,

2120
01:50:48,655 --> 01:50:53,827
I can enable Sprite Kit's per
pixel collisions, field forces

2121
01:50:53,827 --> 01:50:58,866
and lighting effects gaining a
much more interesting result.

2122
01:50:58,866 --> 01:51:02,703
Now, Swift Playgrounds even
give you full power over time.

2123
01:51:02,703 --> 01:51:07,174
And, with this timeline at
the bottom of the screen,

2124
01:51:07,174 --> 01:51:09,777
I can go forwards and backwards

2125
01:51:09,777 --> 01:51:12,379
through the execution
of my game.

2126
01:51:12,379 --> 01:51:15,115
So, I can really see
those effects in action.

2127
01:51:15,115 --> 01:51:17,251
You can see the balloons
interacting with each other

2128
01:51:17,251 --> 01:51:20,687
and with the blimp
just like that.

2129
01:51:20,687 --> 01:51:23,023
Playgrounds give me
unprecedented power

2130
01:51:23,023 --> 01:51:26,593
to see my app in detail and
give me full control when I want

2131
01:51:26,593 --> 01:51:29,763
to refine and polish
my application.

2132
01:51:29,763 --> 01:51:32,833
But, of course, Swift
works great with Xcode

2133
01:51:32,833 --> 01:51:34,601
and runs great on iOS.

2134
01:51:34,601 --> 01:51:38,772
So, let's now jump and see what
the finished product looks like.

2135
01:51:43,477 --> 01:51:45,579
Here we go.

2136
01:51:45,579 --> 01:51:46,980
And, this is the game
that we just built.

2137
01:51:46,980 --> 01:51:49,850
It looks pretty great.

2138
01:51:49,850 --> 01:51:52,119
Now, as Craig told you earlier,

2139
01:51:52,119 --> 01:51:55,022
we've also brought
Scene Kit to iOS.

2140
01:51:55,022 --> 01:51:56,590
With Scene Kit, it's super easy

2141
01:51:56,590 --> 01:51:58,826
to build a 3D version
of our game.

2142
01:51:58,826 --> 01:52:03,664
And, that's just a quick
taste and quick look at Swift.

2143
01:52:03,664 --> 01:52:06,033

to absolutely love it.

It gives you access to all
of Cocoa and Cocoa Touch.

So, you can build everything
from a simple example,

2150

like you saw there with Chris,

2151
01:52:25,719 --> 01:52:29,356
to the most powerful
applications you can imagine.

2152
01:52:29,356 --> 01:52:32,726
And Swift is going to be ready
for primetime out of the gates.

2153
01:52:32,726 --> 01:52:36,430
It comes with complete
Xcode support with indexing,

2154
01:52:36,430 --> 01:52:38,632
code completion and debugging.

2155
01:52:38,632 --> 01:52:42,436
And, there's a Swift language
guide available to you now

01:52:42,436 --> 01:52:46,573
in iBooks along with complete
reference documentation.

2157

And, when iOS and OS X
are available, day one,

2158
01:52:51,111 --> 01:52:55,215
you can submit apps written
in Swift to the App Store.

with technology like
extensions, Metal and Swift.

01:54:25,138 --> 01:54:30,477
This morning, you've seen
Yosemite, the future of OS X

01:54:30,477 --> 01:54:35,649
with an incredible new
design, amazing new features

2188

and engineered to work
seamlessly with iOS.

01:54:39,519 --> 01:54:44,624
You've seen iOS 8, the
biggest release of iOS

2190
01:54:44,624 --> 01:54:47,527
since the introduction
of the App Store.

2191
01:54:47,527 --> 01:54:52,799
It's huge for developers and
massive for everyone else.

And perhaps, more importantly,

2193
01:54:55,635 --> 01:55:00,240
you've seen how our
operating systems, devices

2194
01:55:00,240 --> 01:55:04,544
and services all work
together in harmony.

2195
01:55:04,544 --> 01:55:08,648
Together, they provide
an integrated

and continuous experience
across all of our products.

ever done before

01:55:47,788 --> 01:55:55,062
for our users that is
unparalleled in the industry.

2204
01:55:55,062 --> 01:56:00,567
This is something
only Apple can do.

2205
01:56:00,567 --> 01:56:06,206
You've seen a few people
on stage this morning

2206
01:56:06,206 --> 01:56:12,679
but there are thousands of
people that made today possible.

2207
01:56:12,679 --> 01:56:15,515
And I'd like to take a
moment before we depart

2208
01:56:15,515 --> 01:56:17,117
and recognize them.

2209
01:56:17,117 --> 01:56:21,254
Would everyone from Apple stand
up that had something to do

2210
01:56:21,254 --> 01:56:24,591
with bringing today--
making today possible?

2211
01:56:24,591 --> 01:56:26,526
Stand up, don't be bashful.

2213
01:56:44,010 --> 01:56:46,313
Thank you.

2214
01:56:46,313 --> 01:56:50,350
And, there's thousands more back
in Cupertino who were watching

2215
01:56:50,350 --> 01:56:55,388
and I want to thank them, too,
and from all over the world.

2216
01:56:55,388 --> 01:57:00,127
It's a privilege of a lifetime
for me to work with all

2217
01:57:00,127 --> 01:57:02,329
of these incredible people.

2218
01:57:02,329 --> 01:57:05,632
I hope everyone has
a huge conference.

2219
01:57:05,632 --> 01:57:06,700
Enjoy the week.

2220
01:57:06,700 --> 01:57:08,001
Thank you very much.
