incredibly wellour customer base 

50
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:08,820

to say aboutit 

56
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,890
things like thisfrom All Things D 

57
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,810
there's really no other wayto say this 

58
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:33,040
the Mac is kicking ass now that's really

59
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,910
nice but what did John mean well this is 

60
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,610
what he meansthe last quarter the PC 

61
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:41,470
market actually shrank year-over-year 

62
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,070
one percent while the Mac grew 28% 

63
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,719
and mybook that's an ass-kicking now 

64
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,069
let's do you think this is an aberration

65
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,099
the Mac has outgrown the industry every 

66
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:59,650
quarter forthe past five years it is 

67
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,269
going so strong and it's because the 

68
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,579
productsare incredible products like 

69
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:06,310
the new MacBook Air it's beautifulits 

70
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,500
thinits light its fast the whole PC 

71
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,379
industrywants to copy it but as you 

72
00:04:11,379 --> 00:04:12,700
know we've been leading in notebooks for 

73
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,400
a whilewe're the first to really drive 

74
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,168
the majority ofour PC business to a 

75
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:19,000
notebook business and it's almostthree 

76
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,470
quarters of the Mac's we've shipped 

77
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,979
today but whether you want a great new 

78
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,169
notebook or a killer desktop with the

79
00:04:26,169 --> 00:04:28,660
new iMacthese Macs are the best that we 

80
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,310
have evermade in the history of Apple 

81
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,199
andthey're great not just because of 

82
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,150
the hardware they run but because ofthe 

83
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:38,620
softwareMac os10 is the heart of the 

84
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:41,199
Mac and if you'rekeeping track you know 

85
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,500
we launched Mac OS 1010 years ago we 

86
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,410
built it on a solidUNIX foundation we 

87
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,210
added toit the ease-of-use and 

88
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,979
simplicity that we know Apple is 

89
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:53,410
renowned for and we built intoit 

90
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:55,479
amazing technologies for all ofour 

91
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:57,370
great developers to make the world's

92
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,370
best applications to run onit and for 

93
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,139
thoseof you who are around and remember 

94
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:05,080
this thisis what Mac OS 10 looked like 

95
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,639
10 years ago when we launched it 

96
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:15,810
it was a revolution inits day in over 

97
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,729
thelast ten years it's evolved become 

98
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:19,710

99
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,289

is looking incredibly strongso where do 

101
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,499

I'd love toI'm told I don't even have 

106
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,509
time totell you about ten key new 

107
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,060
featuresso we'll really get into ten 

108
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,490
awesome features first up right into it 

109
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:51,810
number one multi-touch gestures one of 

110
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,400
the great thingsabout the mat from the 

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,409
beginning was thatit uh sure Dan era of 

112
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:57,210
a graphic unit user interface with a

113
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,789
mouseand cooking and dragging but so 

114
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,800
much haschanged over the last 10 years 

115
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,800
we now build multi-touch trackpads into

116
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,180
all of our notebooks andwe offer them 

117
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:08,039
on our desktopswe've learned a lot from 

118
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,389
iOS as well 

119
00:06:09,389 --> 00:06:12,330
so nowlion can count on multi-touch 

120
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,800
from the beginning youcan have 

121
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,589
beautiful fluidmomentum based scrolling 

122
00:06:16,589 --> 00:06:18,930
you canhave incredible multi-touch taps 

123
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,750
to zoom in on stories or pictures you

124
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,610
can dynamically zoom with beautiful

125
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,339
fluid pinch motions you can swipe

126
00:06:26,339 --> 00:06:28,259
throughyour photographs your slides 

127
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,870
yourweb pages all with an incredible 

128
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,430
physical realism that's never been

129
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,259
possible the PC operating system before 

130
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,899
and this has implications across the 

131
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,490
system anda lot of little important 

132
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,580
areas here's a simple examplethe scroll 

133
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,800
bar why do we have scrollbars scroll 

134
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,969
bars were there sothey could click with 

135
00:06:44,969 --> 00:06:47,879
the mouse anddrag and scroll but now if 

136
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:48,899
you'repushing your window with 

137
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:50,819
multi-touch you don't need them they can 

138
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,889
disappear and if a much more beautiful 

139
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:54,120
reading environment but when you go to

140
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,849
scroll they magicallyappear give you a 

141
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,979
senseof place and proportional size and 

142
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:00,649
then disappear when youdon't need them 

143
00:07:00,649 --> 00:07:03,149
so multi-touch is now built throughout

144
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:06,839
the system in a very powerful way number 

145
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,279
two 

146
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:10,620
full screen applicationswe've had some 

147
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,060
full screen applications before and 

148
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,129
theseare really important for notebooks 

149
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:15,689
11 inch and 13 inch where you want to 

150
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:17,669
get take advantage of every pixel onthe 

151
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:19,949
display but developers have hadto work 

152
00:07:19,949 --> 00:07:21,860
hardto make their applications 

153
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,580
hand-coded to do full screen 

154
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,680
applications including apps like like

155
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,810
i photo well now with line we've built 

156
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:29,580
in a standardmethod for developers to 

157
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,770
createfull screen applications and it 

158
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,660
has a simplesystem control on the top 

159
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,060
rightso all users know where to tap and 

160
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,650
then bring their applications full

161
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,780
screen but thisis in full screen like 

162
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,509
it was before because now you can keep 

163
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:43,979
your application running full screen 

164
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:46,919
with a simple swipe gestureget back to 

165
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,960
your desktop get something you need go 

166
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,030
back to applicationnever having left 

167
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,100
full screen in fact you canhave more 

168
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,600
than one full screen application running 

169
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,539
at the same time so we'veworked on a 

170
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,220
numberof our applications to bring them 

171
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:01,199
into the new full screen mode of Lion 

172
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,729
system applications like Safari mail 

173
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:08,460
iCal iLife applicationsiPhoto iMovie 

174
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,550
GarageBandI work with keynote numbers 

175
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:14,070
and pages and all these applications 

176
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,240
goingfullscreen to have a great 

177
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,580
experience rightout of the box here's 

178
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,039
anexample of how it looks this is now 

179
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,530
runningfullscreen in Safari you can 

180
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,270
have a beautiful place for viewing your 

181
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,830

morning so 

224
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,740
let's take a lookat lion in action 

225
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,830
we're going to start with gestures great 

226
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:09,690
played it place to experience gestures 

227
00:10:09,690 --> 00:10:12,240
is here in Safarithe first thing you'll 

228
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,210
notice is apparently something funny is 

229
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:19,020
thathow simple this UI looks because 

230
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:21,720
there are no scroll barsit's a really 

231
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,460
clean look we don't need scroll bars 

232
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,860
anymorebecause we can simply push the 

233
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,840
content with ourfingers we can flick 

234
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,940
and getmomentum get a nice little 

235
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,190
bounce the page feels really alive 

236
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:36,420
beneath your fingers you can also expand 

237
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,780
your fingers and fluidly zoom justlike 

238
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:42,840
thatzoom out and you get a nice little 

239
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,050
bounce page goes right back into place 

240
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,670
if I want to 

241
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,800

242
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,560

I photos still there in full screen as

280
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:18,879
wellyou'll notice how Safari is making 

281
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:21,100
great useof all the available space on 

282
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,350
the screen for my content but if I want 

283
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,509
to get at my bookmarks bar my menu just 

284
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:27,670
go to the topyou see they slide right 

285
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,089

00:12:31,089 --> 00:12:32,800
wantto exit full screen I have a 

287
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,379

00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,110
look nowat photobooth this is an app 

290
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:43,240
absolutely born to runin full screen 

291
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,370
you can see I'm surrounded by the 

292
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,649
curtains of the the photo boothand in 

293
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,199
hereI can experience some fantastic new 

294
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:54,939
face detectioneffects so notice as I 

295
00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:59,550
move thebirds actually track 

296
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,600
it's right it's the most important

297
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,450
feature in line and wecan also use this 

298
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:11,150
face tracking technology to perform some 

299
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,490
targeted facial enhancements for

300
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,920
instanceI can finally have those big 

301
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,050
eyes thatI've always hoped for so that 

302
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:22,130
make a picture of that so that's that's 

303
00:13:22,130 --> 00:13:25,220
pretty cool so playing around yeah 

304
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,490
that's great stuffso you know you can 

305
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:30,830
spendhours at this so fullscreen is 

306
00:13:30,830 --> 00:13:33,590
fantasticbut of course Mac users love 

307
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,210
to get do a lotof things at once and 

308
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,620
that often meansthat they have a lot of 

309
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,080
windows in fact my desktop often looks a 

310
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,760
little bit morelike this right I've got 

311
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,610

well now you can with launchpad you 

423
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:04,610
simply makea simple gesture a pinch 

424

applications thatyou can organize any 

429
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,880
way you want when you go andbuy a new 

430
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,710

432
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:22,820
launchpad and you can make it look 

433

however you like you can rearrange your 

434
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,630
icons youcan create folders just as 

435
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:28,100
we're used tofrom iOS and now you can 

436
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,580
dothat on your Mac as well so that's 

437
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:38,630
launch pad next resume here's a simple 

438
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,040
ideafrom the beginning with the 

439
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,570
computeryou've had to run applications 

440
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:43,820
sometimes you quit them you go back and 

441
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,590
you're backat the starting point you 

442
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:47,900
get you have no more windows open your

443
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,550
documentsaren't open you usually have 

444
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:51,710
to pick a templatewhy can't a plication 

445
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:54,350
x' get you back to work quickly well 

446
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,120
that'sit resume does now when you 

447
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:59,150
launch anapplication and lyan it brings 

448
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,710
youright back to where you were when 

449
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,570
you quitit remembers what documents you 

450
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,130
were opened remembers the text that was 

451
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,020
selected in the document remembers where 

452
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,370
thepalettes were and the windows and 

453
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:09,530
everything just how you like it and 

454
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,970
resume doesn'twork just on an 

455
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:13,880
applicationit works system-wide so the 

456
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,440
next time you have to shutdown and 

457
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,360
restart your your Mac for a reason maybe 

458
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,100
you've installed some new software and 

459
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,080
asked you to reboot get you like 

460
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,850
everythingjust the way it is well don't 

461
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:25,430
worry you get the new login window you 

462
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,890
log inand lion will bring you back to 

463
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,390
the work environmentas you left it when 

464
00:19:29,390 --> 00:19:30,950
you restartedall your applications 

465
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,530
running all those spaces you set up all 

466
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:36,490
just the way you like it

467
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:44,239
so that's resumed number seven autosave 

468
00:19:44,239 --> 00:19:46,559
from the beginning of using computers 

469
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,239
we've all had toremember one really 

470
00:19:48,239 --> 00:19:50,909
important factsave save save all your 

471
00:19:50,909 --> 00:19:52,619
workas you're going whether it's file 

472
00:19:52,619 --> 00:19:54,539
save or commandS on a Mac you better 

473
00:19:54,539 --> 00:19:56,519
keep savingas the one time you might 

474
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:57,899
forgetto save what you're doing 

475
00:19:57,899 --> 00:19:59,549
somethinggoes wrong and what are you 

476
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,169
goingto hear you should have saved what 

477
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:04,289
you're doing why should you whycan't 

478
00:20:04,289 --> 00:20:06,029
the computer help youwell that's what 

479
00:20:06,029 --> 00:20:08,609
lion does as you're creating a document 

480
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:10,979
lion can automatically save it in the

481
00:20:10,979 --> 00:20:12,149
background without you having to do 

482
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:13,229
anythingwithout you having to see 

483
00:20:13,229 --> 00:20:15,119
anything your work is just being saved 

484
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:17,729
for you this is a really powerful but 

485
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,529
simple thing but but as we got into we 

486
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:20,700
found there's more thingswe can do for 

487
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,159
you since we're Auto saving so if you 

488
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,529
zoomin on the title bar of your 

489
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,090
documents you'll see the nameof your 

490
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,619
documentis actually a menu now that you 

491
00:20:28,619 --> 00:20:30,599
can tap on and take advantageof the 

492
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:32,639
powerof autosave but for example let's 

493
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,440
say you're doing work and you don't like 

494
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,580
the work youdid and you're worried it 

495
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,590
gotauto saved over what you liked that 

496
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,239
you've done previouslywell now I can 

497
00:20:39,239 --> 00:20:41,639
just select revert to last open and get 

498
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,979
back towhere you were when you started 

499
00:20:42,979 --> 00:20:45,389
and maybe you love the changes you've 

500
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:46,950
madeand they're exactly what you want 

501
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:48,929
youdon't want it to ever get auto saved 

502
00:20:48,929 --> 00:20:50,249
overit again because it's perfect the 

503
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,349
wayit is you can just select lock and 

504
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,970
now yourdocuments locked it's like a 

505
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,919
templateand nothing can ever change it 

506
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,080
you can even right from within the 

507
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,840
application so like duplicate and create 

508
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,999
a seconddocument just like the first 

509
00:21:02,999 --> 00:21:04,200
one that you can start working on 

510
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,210
anotherversion so you have the power of 

511
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:08,519
all ofthis right from the title bar of 

512
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,700
your window so that'sauto save now auto 

513
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,830
save gave us a great idea to go even 

514
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:16,499
furtherwith the next feature and that's 

515
00:21:16,499 --> 00:21:19,320
called versions so you're workingon a 

516
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,929
document you'reentering the text you're 

517
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:23,669
formattingyou're adding copy you're 

518
00:21:23,669 --> 00:21:27,119
adding graphicsand all along autosave 

519
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,519
is saving your document in fact it's 

520
00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:31,799
savingall these versions of your 

521
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,859
document as you're working so we call 

522
00:21:34,859 --> 00:21:37,049
that versions it's automatic youdon't 

523
00:21:37,049 --> 00:21:38,669
have to do anything we'll do it for you 

524
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:40,769
withLion if you love something at a 

525
00:21:40,769 --> 00:21:42,299
split second you can of coursetake a 

526
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,399
manual snapshot if you want and it's

527
00:21:44,399 --> 00:21:46,499
very efficientwe only store the 

528
00:21:46,499 --> 00:21:48,450
difference betweenthe versions they're 

529
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,800
not whole new documents 

530
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,960
and youdon't have to worry if you ever 

531
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,940
share your work withsomeone else that 

532
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,050
they're goingto get all that back work 

533
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,280
that youwon't don't want them to get 

534
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:58,470
whenyou copy it off or you send it an 

535
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:00,950
emailwe only send the current version 

536
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:03,180
so how doyou get it take advantage of 

537
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,220
thispower of autosave inversions 

538
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,170
well againgo back to that menu on the 

539
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:09,060
topand there's another choice there 

540
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,770
that you may have noticed browse all 

541
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:13,020
versionsyou tap on it and you get this 

542
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:15,330
beautiful new interface it looks a lot 

543
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:17,730
liketime machine but rather than being 

544
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:19,650
about your whole system it's about that 

545
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,780
onedocument you're working on on the 

546
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,700
leftis the current version on the right 

547
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:26,400
all the past versions you have a time 

548
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,810
scaleon the right just like time 

549
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,550
machineyou can scroll back through them 

550
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,710
and they're all live you can switch to 

551
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,090
make anyone the current one you can even 

552
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,550
cut and paste between them so that's 

553
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,470
versionswhat I'd like to do is ask 

554
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:38,910
Craig to come back up andgive another 

555
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,560
demoshowing how this all works together 

556
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,640
Craig again all right well let's let's 

557
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,740
start with launchpad you see it's an 

558
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,830
iconright here on my dock I click I get 

559
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,780
an instant viewof all of the 

560
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,190
applications on my system no matter 

561
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,960
where they're installedI can page 

562
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,520
through themreally nicely with gestures 

563
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,380
and when I want tolaunch let's say like 

564
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,380
address bookit's just a single click to 

565
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,780
bring it up can also gesture with a 

566
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,710
forefinger pinch to get in as well 

567
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,970
so of course when I want toadd things 

568
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,420
to mylaunch pad the best way to do that 

569
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,250
iswith the Mac App Store I'm going to 

570
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:19,290
launch it righthere you can see on the 

571
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:20,940
Mac App Store we have great featured

572
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:24,110
applicationstop paid and free apps

00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:26,820
categories we havealso all of your 

574
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,460
purchase tabsso then if you buy another 

575
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,020
Mac or you buy on one Mac you wantto 

576
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,980
get the app on the other one

577
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,570
youcan download them here at no 

578
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:36,240
additional chargeand of course updates 

579
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,610
with just aclick you can bring all the 

580
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,900
apps youhave installed on your system 

581
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,710
from the App Store 

582
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:43,710
up to date well now let's try adding 

583
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,050
Twitter to our Mac we're going to click 

584
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,580
here and go to the Twitter product page 

585
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,490
and with a clickyou can buy the app 

586
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,770
actually lifts up out of theApp Store 

587
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,290
andflies right into my Launchpad 

588
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,760
downloads and is ready to use 

589
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,370
from here I canjust click and position 

590
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,740
it wherever I wantI can move it maybe 

591
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,270
to the first page

592
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:04,950
and as you seewe have folders like this 

593
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:07,590
productivity folderworks great I want 

594
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,210
to create my own folderjust pick 

595
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:11,580
something up drop it and I've created a 

596
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:15,900
folderjust like that in Launchpad next 

597
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,600
I'dlike to show you just how fantastic 

598
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,120
the Mac is now with Lion working with 

599
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,010
documents I'm going to open the document 

600
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:25,260
that I've been working on here on the 

601
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,150
history of guitarswhen I start editing 

602
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,160
a documentoften I'll position my 

603
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,500
windows just the way I like them like 

604
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,860
this maybe open up some inspectors 

605
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:36,240
position them the way I want them and 

606
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,760
then I'll set down to editing now this 

607
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,679
guitar this looks maybe a little bittoo 

608
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,990
metal for my target audience all delete

609
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:46,710
that take take this move it asidemaybe 

610
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:48,870
change the font hereon this on this 

611
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:51,240
documentso I'm done with my edits for 

612
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:52,950
now and I'm gonna quit and I want you to 

613
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:57,559
watch what happens when I quit 

614
00:24:57,890 --> 00:24:59,490
absolutely nothing

615
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,190
I wasn't prompted to saveI didn't need 

616
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:03,720
to be because lion was actually saving 

617
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,270
for me all along but it wasn't just 

618
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,000
savingmy document it was saving exactly 

619
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,010
the state of how I was workingso now 

620
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,380
when I go back and launch pages again 

621
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:16,080
you see itbrings back all my inspectors 

622
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,940
just the way they werebrings back my 

623
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,040
window position where it was andeven 

624
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,750
has my text selection highlighted just

625
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:25,200
as I left it perfect restore but we're 

626
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,140
notjust storing the latest version of 

627
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,720
thedocument we're keeping a history of 

628
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,820
thedocument as it's edited so if I want 

629
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,679
to go back maybe I regret these edits I 

630
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:35,940
want to getback to the previous version 

631
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:39,030
I go right here and browse all versions 

632
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,520
and I'm taken right into the star field 

633
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:44,160
where I get a view of my current version 

634
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,530
on theleft and the history on the right 

635
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,780
if I wantthis previous version to 

636
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,480
becomecurrent I click restore it picks 

637
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:54,270
up flies on top and becomes the current

638
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,309
version of my document and I'm restored 

639
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:58,260
butyou saw that was actually more 

640
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,240
history than that I'll go back into the 

641
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,340
star field here you can see I actually 

642
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,220
have a full timeline here on the right I 

643
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,990
cango back to the very beginning of 

644
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,370
this document when it was just a few 

645
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:10,740
paragraphsor step forward as I was 

646
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,340
adding pagesand so forth but when I 

647
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,800
restorea document you know very often I 

648
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,300
don't wantreally the holo version I 

649
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,010
likemostly what my new document has 

650
00:26:20,010 --> 00:26:21,600
become but often I want to harvest maybe

651
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,610
just an image or perhaps a particular

652
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,140
slide andbring it into the current 

653
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,530
version with versions I can because 

654
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,560
these two windows are actually live here 

655
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:33,930
so if I have on my current version maybe 

656
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,000
a page that could really use an image to 

657
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,800
punch it upa little bit I go back to 

658
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,540
thispast version I see oh look there's 

659
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,800
there's aguitar that would be just 

660
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,140
perfectwell I can just select the 

661
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,690
guitarand the old version copy it and 

662
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,660
then pasteit right into the latest 

663
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,210
version and like that I've created just 

664
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:54,350
the document I was looking for and 

665
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:02,420
that'sversion thanks Thank You Craig 

666
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,860
next number9 well as long as we've had 

667
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,030
computerswe wanted to share documents 

668
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,160
we have a new feature to help you do 

669
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,270
thatand make it easier than ever it's 

670
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:14,580
called airdrop you've got your computer 

671
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,550
your friends got their computer and 

672
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:19,200
trying toget documents between them has 

673
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,430
always beensuch a pain in fact the 

674
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,650
easiest way to do this that no one's 

675
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:24,840
done better than is good old sneakernet 

676
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,150
copy it off of one walk over to your 

677
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,670
friend's computer copy it back on 

678
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,660
Millian solves that with a new 

679
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,880
technologyairdrop that's a peer-to-peer 

680
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,970
Wi-Fi based networkso how does it work 

681
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:38,340
when you go intothe finder in line 

682
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:40,590
you'llsee on the sources on the Left a 

683
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:43,860
new choicecalled airdrop you tap it you 

684
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,500
get a new display inside the finder what 

685
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,290
you see isyourself Center bottom right 

686
00:27:49,290 --> 00:27:51,450
thereand the people around you who are 

687
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,730
alsorunning airdrop at the same time 

688
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:56,420
you see their picturesI want to drag a 

689
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,830
document over to Shawna's computer I

690
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,080
justdragged the document on top of her 

691
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,460
picture andit asked me are you sure you 

692
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,100
want to sendthis and I confirm I do I'm 

693
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,900
Shauna's computer because she's also now

694
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,780
running airdrop she sees pops up overmy 

695
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,340
pictureI'm trying to send her a 

696
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,080
document she confirms she wants to

697
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,060
receiveit and it downloads right into a 

698
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,370
downloads folder and that's it that's 

699
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:19,050
what it takes to now wirelessly share 

700
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:21,690
files betweenLyon computers so it's a 

701
00:28:21,690 --> 00:28:24,030
peer-to-peer Wi-Fi basednetwork there's 

702
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,740
nothing toset up its auto-discovery 

703
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,830
Auto setup we have confirmation on both 

704
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:30,420
ends just tobe safe 

705
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,000
and your data isprotected over-the-air 

706
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,410
because it's fully encrypted as it's 

707
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:37,950
transferred so that's airdropand that 

708
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:43,770
brings usto number ten number ten is 

709
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,960
maila completely new version of mail 

710
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,720
online it's beautiful the layout on it 

711
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:49,530
is incredible

712
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,480
it works in a window it takesadvantage

hundred million iOS devices 

918
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:38,390

919
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:42,859
operating system with more than 44 

920
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,660

930
00:38:11,299 --> 00:38:12,019

931
00:38:12,019 --> 00:38:17,150

942
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:59,559

momentum of the App Store is really hard 

955
00:39:33,609 --> 00:39:36,990
to fathom there are currently more than 

956
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,579
425 thousand apps on the App Store and 

957
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:45,010
more than90 thousand of these were made 

958
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:48,640
specifically forthe iPad it takes full 

959
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:49,779
advantage of the large touchscreen 

960
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:52,720

number one notifications

1011
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,620
I'm sure you'reall familiar with 

1012
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:47,880
notifications we look something like

1013
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:50,130
thisit looks best when giants are on 

1014
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,220
top soyou get scoring alerts you have 

1015
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,660
alerts to pop up theyget into audio 

1016
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:57,990
they can also badgethe home screen 

1017
00:42:57,990 --> 00:43:01,140
icons well these have been massively 

1018
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,750
popular in fact we have alreadypushed 

1019
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:07,590
more than ahundred billion push 

1020
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:11,540
notificationsis scaled beautifully 

1021
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:13,800
we've heardfrom our customers that are 

1022
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,420
receivingso money they'd like a better 

1023
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:19,020
UI to get them and we agree and so we

1024
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,520
have builtsomething that solves some of 

1025
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:21,480
theproblems in the current one 

1026
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,480
currently when you get a notificationit 

1027
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,210
interrupts you if you're playing a game

1028
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:29,250
you get a modal alert you have to deal 

1029
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,990
with that mode alert before you can go 

1030
00:43:30,990 --> 00:43:34,110
onalso in the lock screen you get this 

1031
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,460
nice list ofthings that have happened 

1032
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,040
while your phone's been locked but when 

1033
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,500
you unlock itthat list isn't persistent 

1034
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:42,390
there's no way to get back to that list 

1035
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:45,030
and go through those notifications well 

1036
00:43:45,030 --> 00:43:47,490
we have designed a solution thatsolves 

1037
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,740
those issuesand goes far beyond it and 

1038
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:52,820
we call it notification center

1039
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,900
Notification Center is a single place

1040
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:00,150
which combines together all of your 

1041
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:02,640
notifications you can get to it at any 

1042
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,580
time from anywhere on your iPhone or 

1043
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,830

1045
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,950
Notification Center

1046
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,890
so we thinkit is beautiful it has your

1048
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,810

righthere in Notification Center and 

1052
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,650
we've evenadded stocks and weather 

1053
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:40,090
right up topnow we didn't stop there 

1054
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:42,560
notifications are no longer interrupting

1055
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,660
so now if you're playing a game and

1059
00:44:56,390 --> 00:44:58,130
andit'll automatically dismiss itself 

1060
00:44:58,130 --> 00:44:59,270
you could have just tapped on it who 

1061
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:01,520
take you to that app but doesn't matter 

1062
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,720
becauseyou can always get back to it 

1063

1064
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:07,010

thelock screen you can see more 

1066
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:15,890
information for notifications here and 

1067

00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:35,020
it eveneasier for all of our customers 

1148
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:38,170
to use Twitter on iOS products we're 

1149
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,089
doing a numberof things for this first 

1150

00:50:08,569 --> 00:50:11,960
manyof our apps like camera and photos 

1162
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:13,940

1179
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,880
of contacts that don't have photos but 

1180
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,799
Twitter may have photos for those people

1181
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,630
and soyou can use Twitter to

mobileweb browsing is done on Safari 

1191
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:45,500
beyond this we took apples Safari engine 

1192
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:48,560
and open sourced it and it's the basis

1193
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:52,670
of all web browsing onAndroid so Safari 

1194
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,550

00:54:25,910 --> 00:54:29,360
extensive reviews in fact youdon't have

00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,220
to tap through many manypages to read 

1244
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:33,170
the whole review but I like this one 

1245
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:37,160
here it's a 20 pages long well if I tap 

1246
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:39,740
the readerbutton here it loads the 

1247
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,680
entire story up andreader now I can 

1248
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,180
just scroll through it gets rid of all 

1249
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:46,400
thedistractions lets me concentrate 

1250
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:51,040
justin the content that is reader 

1251
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,190
you even see thatwhen it goes between 

1252
00:54:58,190 --> 00:55:00,200

don't have time to finish the story 

1258
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,750

01:03:12,410 --> 01:03:16,430
pull on theinbox right from there so 

1416
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:17,839
anywhereyou are when your porch adjust 

1417
01:03:17,839 --> 01:03:19,220
pull iton you have to go hunt up and 

1418
01:03:19,220 --> 01:03:21,440
find the rightbutton for it you can see 

1419
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,119
we're flagging here so I can tap on that 

1420
01:03:23,119 --> 01:03:25,640
flagged messagea one other feature 

1421
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:28,009
we've added is a builtin dictionary 

1422
01:03:28,009 --> 01:03:31,190
throughout the OS as a service now so 

1423
01:03:31,190 --> 01:03:33,799
before we had a dictionary inthe iBooks 

1424
01:03:33,799 --> 01:03:35,970
app but wenow brought that 

1425
01:03:35,970 --> 01:03:38,280
to the entire OS so all apps from the 

1426
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,130
App Store can use it so here if I press 

1427
01:03:41,130 --> 01:03:42,900
downlets and lychees I don't know what 

1428
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:45,150
thatis let's say I get a define in 

1429
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:48,720
addition to copy tap define there it is

1430
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:56,340
built-in dictionary it's great if I say 

1431
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:59,880
respond to thismessage again I can grab 

1432
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,680
oneof these addresses now just drag it 

1433
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,300
to BCC dragged itto and rearrange it 

1434
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:08,010
it'sreally nice and easy as one more 

1435
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:09,690
feature I want to showyou it's actually 

1436
01:04:09,690 --> 01:04:11,100
a system-wide feature having to do with 

1437
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,170
the keyboardwhen we released the 

1438
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:15,480
original iPhone we revolutionized the 

1439
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:17,940
way people would tight onmulti-touch 

1440
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:20,010
displays and we keep on challenging

1441
01:04:20,010 --> 01:04:22,560
ourselvesto make that even better we 

1442
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:24,180
have a new variantof the keyboard in 

1443
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,880
iOS 5 for theiPad which we think people 

1444
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,860
who like to type with their thumbs while 

1445
01:04:28,860 --> 01:04:31,140
holding it are reallygoing to like in 

1446
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,300
thebottom right you see the keyboard 

1447
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:35,970
button and now has some grab handlesif 

1448
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,390
I justtake those and drag it up it 

1449
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:42,290
splits itinto two 

1450
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:47,550
so what it does is it moves the keys 

1451
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:49,650
closer to your thumbs on theside so you 

1452
01:04:49,650 --> 01:04:51,260
can you can put it wherever you want 

1453
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:54,330
it's really nice and it's persistent for 

1454
01:04:54,330 --> 01:04:56,130
every app in the systemit just stays 

1455
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:56,880
whereyou put it 

1456
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,440
we want to put it back downjust press 

1457
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,780
andhold to dock and merge it goes back 

1458
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,580
down to the bottom so even a split 

1459
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:04,790
keyboard

1460
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:19,020
that'smail number eight PC free 

1461
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:41,490
so we built these incredible devicesthe 

1462
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:46,109
iPhonethe iPad and people get them home 

1463
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:51,890
they openup their box and I see this I 

1464
01:05:51,890 --> 01:05:57,089
say well what now we're living in a post 

1465
01:05:57,089 --> 01:05:59,160
PC world in fact especially with the 

1466
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,650
iPad we're offering in the post PC world

1467
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:04,200
we have a lotof customers coming to us 

1468
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,319
andsaying I want to buy an iPad as my 

1469
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:09,720
only device I don't know in a computer I 

1470
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:13,079
wantto buy an iPhone is my only device 

1471
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:14,910
my only actuallyinternet access for 

1472
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:17,480
where I livewill be my iPhone 

1473
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,740
we know we're selling into a lotof 

1474
01:06:19,740 --> 01:06:21,720
places where the households just don't 

1475
01:06:21,720 --> 01:06:24,480
have computersand they want to buy an 

1476
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,519
iOSdevices their only device and that's 

1477
01:06:26,519 --> 01:06:28,109
exactlywhat we're going to support an 

1478
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:33,059
iOS 5now you take your iPhone out of 

1479
01:06:33,059 --> 01:06:35,579
the box insteadof seeing this you're 

1480
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:38,059
goingto see this 

1481
01:06:44,650 --> 01:06:47,260
you can now set up and activate your

1482
01:06:47,260 --> 01:06:49,360
device right on the device and you are 

1483
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:52,840
readyto go it's that easy and of course 

1484
01:06:52,840 --> 01:06:54,100
there's someother things we had to do 

1485
01:06:54,100 --> 01:06:57,130
tomake this possible software updates 

1486
01:06:57,130 --> 01:06:59,910
are now over-the-air 

1487
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,570
so you no longerneed to go and plug 

1488
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,370
into acomputer just to update your 

1489
01:07:10,370 --> 01:07:14,030
software and of course they're now Delta 

1490
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:21,170
updates so instead ofdownloading the 

1491
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,450
entire OS you just download what's 

1492
01:07:23,450 --> 01:07:25,720
changednow the next thing we did is we 

1493
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:28,400
we looked at all ofthe apps in the 

1494
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:31,040
iPhone iPad iPod touch and asked 

1495
01:07:31,040 --> 01:07:33,110
ourselves what are thereasons that 

1496
01:07:33,110 --> 01:07:35,270
people go back to a computer today and 

1497
01:07:35,270 --> 01:07:37,550
let's add that functionalityright to 

1498
01:07:37,550 --> 01:07:40,880
iOSso for instance you have to go back 

1499
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:42,620
to a computerto create calendars or 

1500
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:44,840
delete calendarsyou can now create and 

1501
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,720
delete calendarsright from iOS you saw 

1502
01:07:47,720 --> 01:07:50,030
for photos we've added really 

1503
01:07:50,030 --> 01:07:51,830
significant editing functionality in

1504
01:07:51,830 --> 01:07:53,840
there so you cancrop rotate one tap 

1505
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:56,900
enhance redeye reductionright from 

1506
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,330
withinyour iOS device even in mail now 

1507
01:07:59,330 --> 01:08:01,700
you can create mailboxes and delete 

1508
01:08:01,700 --> 01:08:04,730
mailboxes right fromiOS so we looked at 

1509
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:07,520
all ofthe apps in the i phone and the 

1510
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,120
ipad added that functionality so now if 

1511
01:08:11,120 --> 01:08:14,830
youwant to cut the cord you can 

1512
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:27,689
next is gamecenteriOS is the most 

1513
01:08:27,689 --> 01:08:30,380
popular gamingplatform on the planet 

1514
01:08:30,380 --> 01:08:33,149
there are more than a hundred thousand 

1515
01:08:33,149 --> 01:08:34,799
game and entertainment titlesin the App 

1516
01:08:34,799 --> 01:08:37,799
Storeand so about nine months ago we 

1517
01:08:37,799 --> 01:08:40,078
launched Game Center and we did it to 

1518
01:08:40,078 --> 01:08:41,880
make it even easier for people to find 

1519
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,908
playersto play games against and also 

1520
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:46,770

you're doingagainst your friends well 

1522
01:08:49,828 --> 01:08:54,328
in justnine months we have 50 million 

1523
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:59,790
Game Center users now to put that into 

1524
01:08:59,790 --> 01:09:02,639
perspectiveXbox Live has been around 

1525
01:09:02,639 --> 01:09:06,448
forabout eight years and they have 

1526
01:09:06,448 --> 01:09:11,189
around 30 millionusers so Game Center 

1527
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:14,040
is verypopular and we're making it even 

1528
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,549
better in iOS 5 to make it more fun and 

1529
01:09:17,549 --> 01:09:19,109

people to place on the games that you 

1537
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:38,158

1538
01:09:38,158 --> 01:09:42,089
we've also added gamerecommendations so 

1539
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:43,618
there might be somereally great games 

1540
01:09:43,618 --> 01:09:45,599
outthere maybe they're new that you 

1541
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:47,520
don't knowabout and we'll help you 

1542
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,040

downloadit directly from Game Center 

1545
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:56,730
now this is great both for our customers 

1546
01:09:56,730 --> 01:10:00,000
andfor our developers another thing 

1547
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,500
we've done forour developers is we've 

1548
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,710
added supportfor turn-based games right 

1549
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,880
in to the OS 

1550
01:10:09,630 --> 01:10:12,070
there are some great turn-based games

1551
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,840
out therelike Scrabble but the 

1552
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,310
developer had to do all thework for 

1553
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:18,010
that and now that's supported right out 

1554
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,650
ofthe box in iOS 5 so some really nice 

1555
01:10:20,650 --> 01:10:23,640
enhancements toGame Center 

1556
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:35,320
next is iMessage nowI believe we have 

1557
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,570
the best messaging client out there on 

1558
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:40,810
the iPhoneit works tremendously well to 

1559
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:44,230
send textmessages and photos and videos 

1560
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:49,150

they've been asking us fora messaging 

1564
01:10:57,490 --> 01:11:01,270

1565
01:11:01,270 --> 01:11:03,790

Wi-Fisync to iTunes before you had 

1663
01:16:06,889 --> 01:16:10,070

now whenyou are charging at night let's 

1666
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,270
say your iOS device will automatically

1667
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:19,940
findiTunes over Wi-Fi and sync with it 

1668
01:16:19,940 --> 01:16:22,190
and beforeit sinks it'll back itself up 

1669
01:16:22,190 --> 01:16:23,750
so you automaticallyget backed up every 

1670
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:31,159

1671
01:16:31,159 --> 01:16:32,900

1678
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,659
toxcode instruments in the simulator 

1679
01:16:49,659 --> 01:16:52,730
even core imagewe brought over the 

1680
01:16:52,730 --> 01:16:54,710
powerful core imageframe works with Mac 

1681
01:16:54,710 --> 01:17:00,110
OS10 - iOS this allows developers to do 

1682
01:17:00,110 --> 01:17:02,810
complex imageoperations like redeye 

1683
01:17:02,810 --> 01:17:05,239
reduction face detectionright from 

1684
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:07,340
within their apps so you're asking 

1685
01:17:07,340 --> 01:17:11,270
yourself when are you getting it and the 

1686
01:17:11,270 --> 01:17:13,489

iOS 5 will support the same devicesthat 

1696
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:44,389
we supported with our last software

1697
01:17:44,389 --> 01:17:46,880
update so that's the iPhone 3GS and

1698
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:50,300

1702
01:18:13,130 --> 01:18:14,420
products we wantto tell you about today

1704
01:18:16,100 --> 01:18:19,030

so you like everything so far well I'll 

1706
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:38,580
trynot to blow it so I get to talk 

1707
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:40,860
about iCloudwe've been working on this 

1708
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:43,350
for sometime now and we're really 

1709
01:18:43,350 --> 01:18:48,390
excitedabout it about ten years ago we 

1710
01:18:48,390 --> 01:18:50,760
had one of our most important insights 

1711
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,740
and that was that the PC was going to 

1712
01:18:55,740 --> 01:18:58,560
become the digital hub foryour digital 

1713
01:18:58,560 --> 01:19:02,490
life what does that mean well it meant 

1714
01:19:02,490 --> 01:19:03,810
thatthat's where you were going to put 

1715
01:19:03,810 --> 01:19:05,580
your digital photos where else wereyou 

1716
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,790
going toput them your digital video off 

1717
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:11,460
your digital camcorder and of course

1718
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:13,800
your music right you were going to 

1719
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:17,010
acquire it in the device or potentially

1720
01:19:17,010 --> 01:19:19,770
on your Mac and you were going to

1721
01:19:19,770 --> 01:19:22,040
basically sync it tothe Mac and 

1722
01:19:22,040 --> 01:19:25,080
everything was goingto work fine and it 

1723
01:19:25,080 --> 01:19:28,890
didfor the better part of 10 years but 

1724
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:32,840
it's broken down in the last few years 

1725
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,170
why well because the devices have 

1726
01:19:37,170 --> 01:19:41,370
changedthey now all have music they now 

1727
01:19:41,370 --> 01:19:44,640
all have photos they now all have video

1728
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:48,990
and so if I acquire a song I buy it 

1729
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:52,500
righton my iPhone I want to get that to 

1730
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,230
my other devicesright I pick up my iPad 

1731
01:19:55,230 --> 01:19:57,720
it doesn't havethat song on it so I 

1732
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:00,960
have tosync my iphone to my Mac then I 

1733
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,880
have to sync myother devices to the Mac 

1734
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,650
to getthat song but then they've 

1735
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:06,930
deposited some photoson the Mac so I 

1736
01:20:06,930 --> 01:20:08,850
have to sync the iPhone again with the

1737
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:11,160
Mac to get thosephotos and keeping 

1738
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,770
these devices in syncis driving us 

1739
01:20:13,770 --> 01:20:15,860
crazy

1740
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:23,510
so we've got a great solutionfor this 

1741
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:26,450
problem and we think this solution is 

1742
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,060
our nextbig insight which is we're 

1743
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:32,210
going to demote the PC in theMac to 

1744
01:20:32,210 --> 01:20:36,080
just be a device justlike an iPhone an 

1745
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,950
iPador an iPod touch and we're going to 

1746
01:20:39,950 --> 01:20:42,320
move the digital hub the center of your

1747
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:46,490
digitallife into the cloud because all 

1748
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:48,770
these new devices have communications

1749
01:20:48,770 --> 01:20:50,930
built into them they can all talk to the

1750
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:56,900
cloud whenever they wantand so now if I 

1751
01:20:56,900 --> 01:20:59,450
getsomething on my iPhone it sends up 

1752
01:20:59,450 --> 01:21:01,070
to the cloud immediatelylet's say I 

1753
01:21:01,070 --> 01:21:02,510
take some pictureswith it 

1754
01:21:02,510 --> 01:21:05,420
those pictures are inthe cloud and they 

1755
01:21:05,420 --> 01:21:08,230
are nowpushed down to my devices 

1756
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:11,840
completely automatically and now 

1757
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:13,910
everything isin sync with me not even 

1758
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,550
having to think about it I don't even 

1759
01:21:16,550 --> 01:21:17,930
have to take thedevices out of my 

1760
01:21:17,930 --> 01:21:21,770
pocketI don't have to be near my Mac or 

1761
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:26,030
PCnow some people think the cloud is 

1762
01:21:26,030 --> 01:21:29,720
just a hard disk in the sky right and 

1763
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:33,080
you take a bunchof stuff and you put it 

1764
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:35,600
in yourDropbox or your I disk or 

1765
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:37,610
whatever and it transfers it up to the

1766
01:21:37,610 --> 01:21:39,380
cloudand stores and then you drag 

1767
01:21:39,380 --> 01:21:41,060
whateveryou want back out on your other 

1768
01:21:41,060 --> 01:21:44,240
devices we think it's way morethan that 

1769
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:49,490
and we call it iCloud now iCloud stores 

1770
01:21:49,490 --> 01:21:54,470
your content inthe cloud and wirelessly 

1771
01:21:54,470 --> 01:21:57,320
pushes it to all yourdevices so it 

1772
01:21:57,320 --> 01:22:00,020
automatically uploadsit stores it and 

1773
01:22:00,020 --> 01:22:02,060
automatically pushesit to all your 

1774
01:22:02,060 --> 01:22:05,470
other devices but also it's completely 

1775
01:22:05,470 --> 01:22:09,050
integrated with your apps and so 

1776
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:11,150
everythinghappens automatically and 

1777
01:22:11,150 --> 01:22:17,470
there's nothing new tolearn it just all 

1778
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,780
works

1779
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,860
it just works 

1780
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:30,680
now you might askwhy should I believe 

1781
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:32,150
them they're the ones thatbrought me 

1782
01:22:32,150 --> 01:22:44,540
mobile me it wasn't our finest hour let 

1783
01:22:44,540 --> 01:22:46,719
mejust say that but we learned a lot 

1784
01:22:46,719 --> 01:22:51,110
nowthe three core apps in Mobile me or 

1785
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:54,410
contacts calendar and mail three things

1786
01:22:54,410 --> 01:22:56,200
we'd obviouslylike kept up to date 

1787
01:22:56,200 --> 01:23:01,280
we've thrown them away we've reacted and 

1788
01:23:01,280 --> 01:23:03,800
rewritten them from the ground up to be

1789
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:07,250
iCloud apps and we've put them on all of 

1790
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:12,430
ourdevices so as an example in contacts 

1791
01:23:12,430 --> 01:23:15,800
when I make anew contact on my iPhone 

1792
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:17,989
it's automatically brought up to the

1793
01:23:17,989 --> 01:23:19,630
cloud where it's storedon the cloud 

1794
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:22,940
right the truth is on the cloud and then 

1795
01:23:22,940 --> 01:23:25,370
it's automatically pushed downto my 

1796
01:23:25,370 --> 01:23:27,110
other devicesso they're all in sync 

1797
01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:28,730
it's that easy 

1798
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:32,150
I just update a contacton my iPhone and 

1799
01:23:32,150 --> 01:23:34,580
don't eventhink about it and that 

1800
01:23:34,580 --> 01:23:36,469
contact is updated on all my other

1801
01:23:36,469 --> 01:23:38,900
devices and if I change it on any device 

1802
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:42,320
it's updated on all devices wirelessly 

1803
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,670
automatically withoutme doing a thing 

1804
01:23:45,670 --> 01:23:48,460
so that's contacts here's calendars

1805
01:23:48,460 --> 01:23:52,070
works much thesame way I make a new 

1806
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:55,130
calendar event on my iPhone it's stored

1807
01:23:55,130 --> 01:23:57,469
inthe cloud and it's pushed to my other 

1808
01:23:57,469 --> 01:24:00,830
devices pretty cool 

1809
01:24:00,830 --> 01:24:04,610
we've also added calendar sharing so as

1810
01:24:04,610 --> 01:24:07,640
an example ifI'm sharing a few 

1811
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,070
calendars with my wife school andsoccer 

1812
01:24:10,070 --> 01:24:13,400
calendars let's say right and I add a

1813
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,730
newcalendar for a teacher parent 

1814
01:24:16,730 --> 01:24:20,150
conference on my phone it's again

1815
01:24:20,150 --> 01:24:25,270
automatically pushed up tothe cloud and 

1816
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,950
automaticallypush to my wife's iPhone 

1817
01:24:27,950 --> 01:24:30,869
if she adds

1818
01:24:30,869 --> 01:24:34,530
the key adds an appointment fora soccer 

1819
01:24:34,530 --> 01:24:38,610
game againgoes up to the cloud and back 

1820
01:24:38,610 --> 01:24:40,860
to my iPhoneit's that simple 

1821
01:24:40,860 --> 01:24:44,969
and so calendars has it stores your

1822
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:48,599
calendars in the cloudchanges on any 

1823
01:24:48,599 --> 01:24:50,940
deviceor push to all your devices and 

1824
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,369
we have shared calendarsand we think 

1825
01:24:53,369 --> 01:24:54,900
you're goingto love the new calendars 

1826
01:24:54,900 --> 01:24:56,130
it just works

1827
01:24:56,130 --> 01:25:01,020
and then we have mail mailis in the 

1828
01:25:01,020 --> 01:25:03,630
bestshape of all but it's even better 

1829
01:25:03,630 --> 01:25:06,900
nowwe give you a mail accountant at me 

1830
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:10,080
calm your new messages againour push to 

1831
01:25:10,080 --> 01:25:12,389
all your devicesand like will use 

1832
01:25:12,389 --> 01:25:14,219
through your inboxand folders are all 

1833
01:25:14,219 --> 01:25:16,500
kept up to dateon all devices 

1834
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:22,400
so that's mail and no ads

1835
01:25:29,110 --> 01:25:31,610
we build productsthat we want for 

1836
01:25:31,610 --> 01:25:33,500
ourselvestoo and we just don't want to 

1837
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:37,790
ads so wecan't get there so these are 

1838
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,980
the three appsthat form the core of 

1839
01:25:39,980 --> 01:25:43,040
mobile me we used to sell them for a 

1840
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:47,450
subscription price of $99 annually as of

1841
01:25:47,450 --> 01:25:51,310
today this product ceases to existand 

1842
01:25:51,310 --> 01:25:55,030
thosethree apps are 

1843
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:12,239
but we didn't stop therewe've got three 

1844
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,670
more apps that we've broughtinto the 

1845
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:20,489
iCloud universe the first is of course 

1846
01:26:20,489 --> 01:26:25,020

1849
01:26:30,180 --> 01:26:31,070

and that app is automatically sent to 

1859
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,790
that device right and there's no extra 

1860
01:26:59,790 --> 01:27:00,230
charge

1861
01:27:00,230 --> 01:27:04,440

1877
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:55,510
readingit on one device let's say 

1878
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:57,600
you're readingit on your iPad and 

1879
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,330

1881
01:28:03,550 --> 01:28:05,260
sentup to the cloud and stored and 

1882
01:28:05,260 --> 01:28:08,110
again push to all yourother devices so 

1883
01:28:08,110 --> 01:28:09,940
maybe you can read anotherthe rest of 

1884
01:28:09,940 --> 01:28:11,620
the chapter as an exampleon the train 

1885
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:16,140
towork it all just works 

1886
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:24,470
and now back up we talked about beingPC 

1887
01:28:24,470 --> 01:28:26,930
freeScott talked about how you can 

1888
01:28:26,930 --> 01:28:31,400
wirelesslybackup your devices daily to 

1889
01:28:31,400 --> 01:28:34,850
your PC or yourMac but let's do it to 

1890
01:28:34,850 --> 01:28:37,430
the cloud as well for thosepeople that 

1891
01:28:37,430 --> 01:28:39,380
want to be completely PC free so we've 

1892
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:43,540
addedwireless backup to the cloud and 

1893
01:28:43,540 --> 01:28:48,440
basicallyonce daily we're going to 

1894
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:51,140
backup a lot of your important contents

1895
01:28:51,140 --> 01:28:53,930
to the cloud if you ever get a new phone

1896
01:28:53,930 --> 01:28:56,060
and have to replace a phone you 

1897
01:28:56,060 --> 01:28:57,770
literally type in your Apple ID and 

1898
01:28:57,770 --> 01:28:59,960
password and everything will be loaded 

1899
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:03,850
onto that phone automatically and wires 

1900
01:29:09,169 --> 01:29:13,289
so we automatically do daily backups to

1901
01:29:13,289 --> 01:29:16,309
iCloud over Wi-Fi

1902
01:29:16,309 --> 01:29:19,619
webackup your purchase music apps and 

1903
01:29:19,619 --> 01:29:23,309
books we backup your camera roll with 

1904
01:29:23,309 --> 01:29:26,429
your photos and videos we backup your

1905
01:29:26,429 --> 01:29:29,309
device settingsand we backup your app 

1906
01:29:29,309 --> 01:29:38,489
data all to the cloud so that isbackup 

1907
01:29:38,489 --> 01:29:43,079
and those are three other apps that come 

1908
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:46,939
with iCloud but we couldn't stop there

1909
01:29:46,939 --> 01:29:53,459
and so we have a final three apps that 

1910
01:29:53,459 --> 01:29:57,059
areamazing the most inventive part of 

1911
01:29:57,059 --> 01:30:01,199
iCloudI think and I'd love to tell you 

1912
01:30:01,199 --> 01:30:07,169
about the first one is documents in the 

1913
01:30:07,169 --> 01:30:16,559
cloud so if I'm on my iPad and I create 

1914
01:30:16,559 --> 01:30:21,179
a page as documentsright I create a 

1915
01:30:21,179 --> 01:30:23,879
Pages documentand it automatically 

1916
01:30:23,879 --> 01:30:27,109
uploadsit and stores it in the cloud 

1917
01:30:27,109 --> 01:30:30,239
when I close that document completely 

1918
01:30:30,239 --> 01:30:33,059
automaticallyand it then pushes it to 

1919
01:30:33,059 --> 01:30:37,409
all the devicesthat I have pages on so 

1920
01:30:37,409 --> 01:30:40,499
I can get the document between my

1921
01:30:40,499 --> 01:30:46,369
devices and we have put that into Pages 

1922
01:30:46,369 --> 01:30:50,639
Numbers and Keynoteas a matter of fact 

1923
01:30:50,639 --> 01:30:53,070
the versions wejust released last week 

1924
01:30:53,070 --> 01:30:57,899
have this in there and to demonstrate 

1925
01:30:57,899 --> 01:31:00,839
what this is like with I work I'd love 

1926
01:31:00,839 --> 01:31:03,510
to invite Roger Rosner who's our VP of I 

1927
01:31:03,510 --> 01:31:07,099
work up to giveus a quick demo 

1928
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:11,220
thank you Steve

1929
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,860
all right let's take a look at how I 

1930
01:31:14,860 --> 01:31:18,100
work andiCloud will work together let's 

1931
01:31:18,100 --> 01:31:19,240
say you'reworking on a keynote 

1932
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:21,880
presentationon your iPad making a 

1933
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:23,560
beautiful presentation with all those 

1934
01:31:23,560 --> 01:31:25,600

1943
01:31:45,610 --> 01:31:48,250
additional chargeso let's fire up 

1944
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:50,410
keynote onthis phone this is the first 

1945
01:31:50,410 --> 01:31:52,000
time we've run ithere so it's going to 

1946
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:54,850
say hithen it's going to say do you 

1947
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:57,960
want to use iCloud we say yes and 

1948
01:31:57,960 --> 01:32:00,370
immediatelyit sees all your keynote 

1949
01:32:00,370 --> 01:32:01,810
presentations you've been working onin 

1950
01:32:01,810 --> 01:32:03,850
the cloud and starts to download them in 

1951
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:06,670
thebackground to your iPhone so I'll 

1952
01:32:06,670 --> 01:32:08,410
openthis one we were just looking at 

1953
01:32:08,410 --> 01:32:10,960
and as you cansee it's all there 

1954
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,850
it even remembered what slide we were

1955
01:32:12,850 --> 01:32:15,490
looking at and if I wantto I can just 

1956
01:32:15,490 --> 01:32:18,960
hit play play it right on my iPhone and 

1957
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:21,850
I'd put exactly zero effort into getting 

1958
01:32:21,850 --> 01:32:26,340
thatfile over here pretty 

1959
01:32:32,170 --> 01:32:35,560
of course all the iWork appsuse iCloud 

1960
01:32:35,560 --> 01:32:38,500
so let's take a look at pagesand you 

1961
01:32:38,500 --> 01:32:39,670
know what imagine you're out and you

1962
01:32:39,670 --> 01:32:41,440
you're inspiredto make some changes to 

1963
01:32:41,440 --> 01:32:44,350
a document you've been working on so I'm 

1964
01:32:44,350 --> 01:32:47,340
going to move this graphic over here 

1965
01:32:47,340 --> 01:32:49,810
maybe Ijust took a photograph that I 

1966
01:32:49,810 --> 01:32:51,219
thinkwould be great to spruce up my 

1967
01:32:51,219 --> 01:32:53,110
cover page so I'll go tomy camera roll 

1968
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:55,530
I'd serve my graphic 

1969
01:32:55,530 --> 01:32:58,409
here's alignment guides to place it and

1970
01:32:58,409 --> 01:33:01,750
I'm doneand I stick the phone in my 

1971
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:04,869
pocket and I forget about it and in the 

1972
01:33:04,869 --> 01:33:06,820
backgroundiCloud is grabbing all those 

1973
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,770
changes and then immediately pushing 

1974
01:33:08,770 --> 01:33:11,619
them backdown to my iPad so when I get 

1975
01:33:11,619 --> 01:33:12,159
home 

1976
01:33:12,159 --> 01:33:15,280
pick up theiPad fire up pages you can 

1977
01:33:15,280 --> 01:33:16,989
see in the upper left my document 

1978
01:33:16,989 --> 01:33:20,040
thumbnailsalready been updated 

1979
01:33:25,570 --> 01:33:28,760
and there are all my editsabsolutely no 

1980
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:32,330
effort on my part and that is how I work 

1981
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:34,310
works with iCloudI think you're going 

1982
01:33:34,310 --> 01:33:34,730
to like it

1983
01:33:34,730 --> 01:33:45,580
thank you thanks Roger 

1984
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:50,930
and documents in the cloud really

1985
01:33:50,930 --> 01:33:55,400
completesour iOS document storage story 

1986
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:59,420
- in other words a lot of us have been 

1987
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:03,110
working for 10 years to get rid of the 

1988
01:34:03,110 --> 01:34:06,170
filesystem so the user didn't have to 

1989
01:34:06,170 --> 01:34:08,890
worry about it when you try to teach

1990
01:34:08,890 --> 01:34:11,450
teach somebody how to use aMac the 

1991
01:34:11,450 --> 01:34:13,390
easiest of allcomputers to use 

1992
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:15,710
everything's going along fine until you 

1993
01:34:15,710 --> 01:34:16,880
hitthe file system and then the 

1994
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,150
difficulty is staggering for most people

1995
01:34:20,150 --> 01:34:24,410
so we've made it on the iOS devices to 

1996
01:34:24,410 --> 01:34:25,670
where you don'tever have to think about 

1997
01:34:25,670 --> 01:34:28,610
it the app manages the presentation of 

1998
01:34:28,610 --> 01:34:31,100
its own documents just like mail manages

1999
01:34:31,100 --> 01:34:34,520
the presentation of its own messagesbut 

2000
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,980
the piece thatwe weren't finished with 

2001
01:34:36,980 --> 01:34:39,710
was how do wemove those documents 

2002
01:34:39,710 --> 01:34:41,920
around to different devices and 

2003
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,540
documents in the cloudsolves that 

2004
01:34:44,540 --> 01:34:48,770
problem for us apps canstore documents 

2005
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:52,940
in iCloudiCloud pushes those documents 

2006
01:34:52,940 --> 01:34:56,360
toa user's devices automatically the 

2007
01:34:56,360 --> 01:34:58,430
documents update onall devices when 

2008
01:34:58,430 --> 01:35:03,410
changed on any device and we are

2009
01:35:03,410 --> 01:35:07,930
releasingAPI 

2010
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:14,240
so

2011
01:35:14,240 --> 01:35:18,080
it's reallyeasy to tie your apps into 

2012
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:22,070
iCloud's storage system and again you 

2013
01:35:22,070 --> 01:35:24,530
canhave complex documents apps like 

2014
01:35:24,530 --> 01:35:26,930
pagesor we've got another storage 

2015
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:31,400
facility for key value dataso as an 

2016
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:32,630
example if you've got an app that just 

2017
01:35:32,630 --> 01:35:35,450
track stocks you can just update the key 

2018
01:35:35,450 --> 01:35:37,190
value pairsand we'll store that in the 

2019
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:42,140
cloudas well so documents and key value 

2020
01:35:42,140 --> 01:35:45,530
data works across all iOS devicesand 

2021
01:35:45,530 --> 01:35:49,780
Macs and PCsto 

2022
01:35:56,200 --> 01:35:58,060
so we think this isgoing to be pretty 

2023
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:03,090
bigand that is documents in the cloud 

2024
01:36:03,180 --> 01:36:08,640
this next one is maybe my favorite one 

2025
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:14,440
and it's called Photo Stream and it's 

2026
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:18,340
goingto bring the cloud to photos how 

2027
01:36:18,340 --> 01:36:21,340
many times havewe taken photos on our 

2028
01:36:21,340 --> 01:36:23,200
iPhone maybe of our kids in the

2029
01:36:23,200 --> 01:36:26,890
afternoon andwanted when we got home to 

2030
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:29,500
share them on an iPadand have to go 

2031
01:36:29,500 --> 01:36:31,620
through the process of moving them over 

2032
01:36:31,620 --> 01:36:33,700
wouldn't it be great if by the time I 

2033
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:35,500
gothome they were already there on the 

2034
01:36:35,500 --> 01:36:38,680
iPad well that's what Photo Stream is 

2035
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,720
going to dofor us across all of our 

2036
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:44,470
devicesso again I take photos on any 

2037
01:36:44,470 --> 01:36:49,360
device puts it in thecamera roll and 

2038
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:51,250
thatwill be automatically uploaded to 

2039
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:54,540
the cloud where it's storedand 

2040
01:36:54,540 --> 01:36:57,130
automatically downloaded to all my other 

2041
01:36:57,130 --> 01:37:00,900
devices including in this case a Mac and 

2042
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:05,230
so I've got my photos onmy iPad just 

2043
01:37:05,230 --> 01:37:09,940
waiting forme when I get home now in 

2044
01:37:09,940 --> 01:37:13,330
additionI can import photos right into 

2045
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:16,720
iPhoto as anexample on the Mac it'll 

2046
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:18,760
upload those to the cloud and do exactly 

2047
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,040
the samething with them by pushing them 

2048
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:22,690
down to all my other devices so it's 

2049
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:24,790
apps thatI its photos that I take or 

2050
01:37:24,790 --> 01:37:29,740
photosthat I import and we built this 

2051
01:37:29,740 --> 01:37:32,080
right intothe apps I hope you've seen 

2052
01:37:32,080 --> 01:37:34,090
that as we've gone through this we've

2053
01:37:34,090 --> 01:37:35,860
built thisright into the app so there's 

2054
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:39,430
nothingnew to learn so photo stream on 

2055
01:37:39,430 --> 01:37:41,470
the iPads photo app we've built it right 

2056
01:37:41,470 --> 01:37:44,560
in rightnext to albums we have a button 

2057
01:37:44,560 --> 01:37:45,970
called Photo Stream you push it and 

2058
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:48,280
you're looking at the photo stream it's 

2059
01:37:48,280 --> 01:37:50,830
that simplethere's not a separate app 

2060
01:37:50,830 --> 01:37:53,020
that youhave to go learn it's right 

2061
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,300
there in yourPhotos app it's right 

2062
01:37:55,300 --> 01:37:57,520
there in your Photos app on youriPhone 

2063
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:59,650
it's just right therewith all your 

2064
01:37:59,650 --> 01:38:04,800
other albums there you goPhoto Stream 

2065
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:11,670
on themap on the map we built it right 

2066
01:38:11,670 --> 01:38:14,369
into iPhotoand so it's right there on 

2067
01:38:14,369 --> 01:38:19,590
the side your photo stream and on a PC 

2068
01:38:19,590 --> 01:38:22,429
they don't have aPhotos app so we use 

2069
01:38:22,429 --> 01:38:28,290
the pictures folder rightin addition to 

2070
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:32,690
that we've even built it in to Apple TV 

2071
01:38:32,690 --> 01:38:40,860
soApple TV Apple TV talks directly over 

2072
01:38:40,860 --> 01:38:43,230
theinternet directly to the photo 

2073
01:38:43,230 --> 01:38:45,840
stream servers doesn't even gothrough 

2074
01:38:45,840 --> 01:38:48,690
your PC talks directlythe photo stream 

2075
01:38:48,690 --> 01:38:50,429
serversso you can watch the photos 

2076
01:38:50,429 --> 01:38:59,010
righton your Apple TV so one of the 

2077
01:38:59,010 --> 01:39:01,860
problems we faced was it will photos are 

2078
01:39:01,860 --> 01:39:03,929
large andwill use up all the memory on 

2079
01:39:03,929 --> 01:39:05,599
your devices 

2080
01:39:05,599 --> 01:39:07,949
there are also large they'll consume

2081
01:39:07,949 --> 01:39:09,810
vast amounts ofstorage in our server 

2082
01:39:09,810 --> 01:39:12,659
farms so we've came up with a great

2083
01:39:12,659 --> 01:39:15,690
scheme we're going to store photos on 

2084
01:39:15,690 --> 01:39:18,000
your deviceswe're going to store the 

2085
01:39:18,000 --> 01:39:21,750
last thousand photosright let's store 

2086
01:39:21,750 --> 01:39:24,270
the lastthousand and any photos you 

2087
01:39:24,270 --> 01:39:26,250
wantto keep permanently just move them 

2088
01:39:26,250 --> 01:39:28,159
into analbum and they'll stay forever 

2089
01:39:28,159 --> 01:39:31,290
but they'll be parading by youthe last 

2090
01:39:31,290 --> 01:39:34,610
thousand photographson your Mac or PC 

2091
01:39:34,610 --> 01:39:36,900
because we have more storage will store 

2092
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:38,909
allof them you can get rid of them by 

2093
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:41,130
justdeleting them but we'll store all 

2094
01:39:41,130 --> 01:39:43,829
of them and on the server will store 

2095
01:39:43,829 --> 01:39:45,690
themfor 30 days which is more than 

2096
01:39:45,690 --> 01:39:47,159
enough time for all your devices to 

2097
01:39:47,159 --> 01:39:50,099
connect and automatically download those 

2098
01:39:50,099 --> 01:39:53,130
photos sowe think we've got a great 

2099
01:39:53,130 --> 01:39:55,739
system here that's going to move our 

2100
01:39:55,739 --> 01:39:57,750
photos aroundamong all of our devices 

2101
01:39:57,750 --> 01:40:00,719
evenApple TV so that when I take a 

2102
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:04,079
photo anywhereI can view it on all my 

2103
01:40:04,079 --> 01:40:06,719
otherdevices we think this is going to 

2104
01:40:06,719 --> 01:40:09,030
be really excitingto demonstrate this 

2105
01:40:09,030 --> 01:40:11,159
I've askedTeddy Q or VP of Internet 

2106
01:40:11,159 --> 01:40:12,420
services to come on up and giveus a 

2107
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:15,739
demoof photo stream 

2108
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:21,000
thanks toyou yep so I want to take some 

2109
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,340

2150
01:43:00,639 --> 01:43:07,250
last butnot least is iTunes in the 

2151
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,340
cloud 

2152
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:18,340

iPhone it ain't there well the first 

2159
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:37,300
thing we've done again is for the songs 

2160
01:43:37,300 --> 01:43:39,730

2161
01:43:39,730 --> 01:43:43,540

2162
01:43:43,540 --> 01:43:45,750

2163
01:43:45,750 --> 01:43:48,219
iTunes songs you bought on any device

2164
01:43:48,219 --> 01:43:51,040
you can look at it by all songs or 

2165
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,320
recent songs or you canlook at it by 

2166
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,570

2168
01:43:57,790 --> 01:44:01,150
albums thatI've bought on iTunes to 

2169
01:44:01,150 --> 01:44:03,489
thisdevice just by pushing that cloud 

2170
01:44:03,489 --> 01:44:07,390
download button or I could go in to one

2171
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:10,030
of them and just download whatever songs 

2172
01:44:10,030 --> 01:44:13,270

2173
01:44:13,270 --> 01:44:16,210

2174
01:44:16,210 --> 01:44:20,110

multiple downloads two different devices 

2179
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:38,300
and for the future I flick one switch to 

2180
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:42,980

2181
01:44:42,980 --> 01:44:48,050

iTunesbut it's not in the music library 

2190
01:45:18,530 --> 01:45:20,780

2191
01:45:20,780 --> 01:45:22,600

2192
01:45:22,600 --> 01:45:25,489

2200
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:44,739

2205
01:46:02,360 --> 01:46:04,940
no additional costlet's go ahead and 

2206
01:46:04,940 --> 01:46:07,150
play it

2207
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:27,260
just finishing downloading now that's

2208
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:28,969
great but iTunes in the cloud is even

2209
01:46:28,969 --> 01:46:30,500
betterlet's see what happens when I 

2210
01:46:30,500 --> 01:46:32,690
purchase a new song and if we can bring

2211
01:46:32,690 --> 01:46:34,730

2212
01:46:34,730 --> 01:46:38,110

new albumI know he has a hit song I 

2217
01:46:48,080 --> 01:46:50,300

2218
01:46:50,300 --> 01:47:01,400
itwe can preview it that's definitely 

2219
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:02,780
it now I'm going to buy it but before I 

2220
01:47:02,780 --> 01:47:05,480
donotice on my iPad I don't have any 

2221
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:08,989
Bruno Mars songs at all so we're going

2222
01:47:08,989 --> 01:47:13,580
togo and buy and it's now downloading 

2223
01:47:13,580 --> 01:47:16,219
to my iPhoneand in addition there's the 

2224
01:47:16,219 --> 01:47:18,969
BrunoMars song 

2225
01:47:25,449 --> 01:47:32,560
and of course thequail I just wanna 

2226
01:47:32,560 --> 01:47:36,070
make so now when I buy a song on one of 

2227
01:47:36,070 --> 01:47:38,080
my devicesit automatically downloads to 

2228
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:40,120
all of my deviceswithout having to sync 

2229
01:47:40,120 --> 01:47:42,910
or do any work atall and that's iTunes 

2230
01:47:42,910 --> 01:47:45,120
in the cloud

2231
01:47:52,090 --> 01:47:55,539
thank you verymuch is this awesome 

2232
01:47:55,539 --> 01:48:00,769
so musicpurchase from iTunes high 

2233
01:48:00,769 --> 01:48:04,579
quality 256 kilobits AAC and you can 

2234
01:48:04,579 --> 01:48:07,460
haveup to 10 devices downloading your 

2235
01:48:07,460 --> 01:48:09,079
music to all of them everytime you buy 

2236
01:48:09,079 --> 01:48:14,420
it on any deviceiTunes in the cloud so 

2237
01:48:14,420 --> 01:48:20,329
these9 apps constitute iCloud and they 

2238
01:48:20,329 --> 01:48:31,369
are all free we want we wantevery user 

2239
01:48:31,369 --> 01:48:33,650
totake advantage of these and we know 

2240
01:48:33,650 --> 01:48:35,780
if we make them free that they'll they

2241
01:48:35,780 --> 01:48:38,780
will and we wantpeople to see what 

2242
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:41,539
these devices can really do and what the 

2243
01:48:41,539 --> 01:48:43,099
softwarecan really do so we're making 

2244
01:48:43,099 --> 01:48:46,719
it free and we're very excited about it 

2245
01:48:46,719 --> 01:48:51,469
so that's iCloudit stores your content 

2246
01:48:51,469 --> 01:48:54,019
and wirelessly pushes it to all your

2247
01:48:54,019 --> 01:48:57,199
devices and it's integrated with your 

2248
01:48:57,199 --> 01:49:00,519
appsso everything happens automatically 

2249
01:49:00,519 --> 01:49:04,099
so a competitor that doesn't own the 

2250
01:49:04,099 --> 01:49:06,889
appsor doesn't have great developers to 

2251
01:49:06,889 --> 01:49:09,860
integratewith their apps they can never 

2252
01:49:09,860 --> 01:49:13,070
do thisthey can never make it so it 

2253
01:49:13,070 --> 01:49:15,860
just works and that's what we've done 

2254
01:49:15,860 --> 01:49:19,749
here so how do you get it well when you 

2255
01:49:19,749 --> 01:49:22,730
upgradeyour phone or buy a new phone 

2256
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:25,730
with iOS 5 on itall you have to do is 

2257
01:49:25,730 --> 01:49:27,769
type inyour Apple ID and password and 

2258
01:49:27,769 --> 01:49:31,960

for mail documents and backup and that's 

2264
01:49:47,300 --> 01:49:50,030
even more than it sounds like because 

2265
01:49:50,030 --> 01:49:52,519
we're not countingpurchase music apps 

2266
01:49:52,519 --> 01:49:56,980

nor arewe counting photostream 

2268
01:50:02,540 --> 01:50:09,980

2283
01:50:55,400 --> 01:51:02,560
this fallso that is iCloud 

2284
01:51:12,659 --> 01:51:21,500
now there'sone more thing a small thing 

2285
01:51:21,500 --> 01:51:24,960
it pertains to iTunes in the cloudas 

2286
01:51:24,960 --> 01:51:27,179
you recall iTunes in the cloud is just

2287
01:51:27,179 --> 01:51:29,820
for the music that you've purchased from 

2288
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:32,750
theiTunes Store now at 14 billion songs 

2289
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:35,550
15 billion excuse me that's a lot of 

2290
01:51:35,550 --> 01:51:36,540
songs out there 

2291
01:51:36,540 --> 01:51:38,850
they've been purchased fromiTunes Music 

2292
01:51:38,850 --> 01:51:42,480
Store but you may have some that you 

2293
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:46,440
ripped yourselfand there's three ways 

2294
01:51:46,440 --> 01:51:48,780
youcan deal with that one 

2295
01:51:48,780 --> 01:51:52,429
you can syncyour new devices over Wi-Fi 

2296
01:51:52,429 --> 01:51:55,620
or cable a cable and you only have to 

2297
01:51:55,620 --> 01:51:57,179
sync them once just toget that music on 

2298
01:51:57,179 --> 01:52:00,090
them and thenyou can rely on iCloud to 

2299
01:52:00,090 --> 01:52:01,860
take careof getting all your new 

2300
01:52:01,860 --> 01:52:05,510
purchases off iTunes onto that device or 

2301
01:52:05,510 --> 01:52:09,630
if it's just a few songs you love you 

2302
01:52:09,630 --> 01:52:11,159
don't leave behind you can buy those 

2303
01:52:11,159 --> 01:52:15,300
songsthat you'll miss on iTunes we're 

2304
01:52:15,300 --> 01:52:17,580
going tooffer a third way which is 

2305
01:52:17,580 --> 01:52:21,860
callediTunes Match what is iTunes Match 

2306
01:52:21,860 --> 01:52:25,699
well iTunes Match uses the fact that

2307
01:52:25,699 --> 01:52:30,210
we've got 18 million songs now in the 

2308
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:32,909
iTunesMusic Store and the chances are 

2309
01:52:32,909 --> 01:52:35,820
awfully goodthat we've got the songs in 

2310
01:52:35,820 --> 01:52:39,719
our storethat you've ripped and so we 

2311
01:52:39,719 --> 01:52:43,590
wrote softwareto scan those CDs the 

2312
01:52:43,590 --> 01:52:48,060
ripsi teen on iTunes music and match it 

2313
01:52:48,060 --> 01:52:51,380
upwith those songs we have in the store 

2314
01:52:51,380 --> 01:52:54,929
right andso we can give that music the 

2315
01:52:54,929 --> 01:52:56,909
same benefits as music purchase from

2316
01:52:56,909 --> 01:53:00,810
iTunes and it takes just minutes not 

2317
01:53:00,810 --> 01:53:02,850
weeksif you have to upload your whole 

2318
01:53:02,850 --> 01:53:05,550
library into someLocker in the sky that 

2319
01:53:05,550 --> 01:53:09,239
literally takes weeks this takes minutes 

2320
01:53:09,239 --> 01:53:12,389
because we're scanning and matching your 

2321
01:53:12,389 --> 01:53:14,840
library sowe don't need to upload that 

2322
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:17,310
that largepart of your library and the 

2323
01:53:17,310 --> 01:53:19,409
few songs thatremain well we'll upload 

2324
01:53:19,409 --> 01:53:23,130
them but with 18 million songs they're 

2325
01:53:23,130 --> 01:53:26,719
most likely to have what you've got

2326
01:53:31,800 --> 01:53:35,940
in addition iTunes Match will upgrade

2327
01:53:35,940 --> 01:53:39,090
those songs that match the 256 kilobits 

2328
01:53:39,090 --> 01:53:41,630
AAC

2329
01:53:47,260 --> 01:53:51,620
and iTunes Match cost just $24.99 a year 

2330
01:53:51,620 --> 01:53:56,750
so if you'vegot a bunch of music if 

2331
01:53:56,750 --> 01:53:58,220

2332

comparethat to some competitors let's 

2337
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:10,940
just look at Appleand Amazon and Google 

2338
01:54:10,940 --> 01:54:14,960
your kind of get surprised because again 

2339
01:54:14,960 --> 01:54:17,480
the library in the cloudwe scan and 

2340
01:54:17,480 --> 01:54:19,430
matchthe other guys you got to upload 

2341
01:54:19,430 --> 01:54:22,220
your wholemusic library again it's 

2342
01:54:22,220 --> 01:54:27,050
going to take weeks music apps on your 

2343
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:29,960
Macand PC and while you're stuck with a 

2344
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:35,330
web app instead of iTunes upgradeto 256 

2345
01:54:35,330 --> 01:54:37,580
kilobits per second theother guys 

2346
01:54:37,580 --> 01:54:41,000
aren't upgrading you at all the annual

2347
01:54:41,000 --> 01:54:44,230
price for5,000 songs we're $24.99 

2348
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:46,880
Amazon charges you $50 for the storage 

2349
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:48,140
andGoogle hasn't announced their 

2350
01:54:48,140 --> 01:54:51,890
pricing yet evenat 20,000 songs we 

2351
01:54:51,890 --> 01:54:55,040
charge one flat price Amazon's up to 

2352
01:54:55,040 --> 01:54:57,620
$200 for the storage and Google has an 

2353
01:54:57,620 --> 01:55:00,460
announcerpresent 

2354
01:55:08,250 --> 01:55:10,690
most ofour customers won't need this 

2355
01:55:10,690 --> 01:55:12,460
because they bought a lot of their music 

2356
01:55:12,460 --> 01:55:14,080
oniTunes but for those that do 

2357
01:55:14,080 --> 01:55:18,100
it's anindustry-leading offering let's 

2358
01:55:18,100 --> 01:55:19,110
put itthat way 

2359
01:55:19,110 --> 01:55:22,780
so that's iTunes Matchand it goes along 

2360
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:25,030
with freeiTunes in the cloud 

2361
01:55:25,030 --> 01:55:30,030
and that's what it isnow 

2362
01:55:37,440 --> 01:55:39,880
if you don't think we'reserious about 

2363
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:47,170
this you're wrong this is our third data 

2364
01:55:47,170 --> 01:55:50,920
centerthat we just completed it's in 

2365
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:55,150
Maidan North Carolina this is what it 

2366
01:55:55,150 --> 01:55:55,600
looks like

2367
01:55:55,600 --> 01:56:00,910
it's rather largeit's as eco-friendly 

2368
01:56:00,910 --> 01:56:03,550
asyou can make a data center with 

2369
01:56:03,550 --> 01:56:06,970

2370
01:56:06,970 --> 01:56:09,910

2371
01:56:09,910 --> 01:56:10,680
size

2372
01:56:10,680 --> 01:56:12,940
see those two littledots on the roof 

2373
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:17,080
those are two peopleright there so it's 

2374
01:56:17,080 --> 01:56:21,250
a pretty large place and and it's a full

2375
01:56:21,250 --> 01:56:25,390
of stuff a little expensive stuff okay

2376
