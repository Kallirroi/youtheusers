Good morning.

(cheering)

5
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:24,557
Welcome to Google I/O.

6
00:00:24,557 --> 00:00:27,087
It's a beautiful day;
I think warmer than last year.

7
00:00:27,087 --> 00:00:29,809
I hope you're all enjoying it.
Thank you for joining us.

8
00:00:29,809 --> 00:00:34,022
I think we have
over 7,000 people here today.

9
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:36,942
As well as many, many people--

10
00:00:36,942 --> 00:00:40,062
we're live streaming this
to many locations around the world.

11
00:00:40,062 --> 00:00:43,254
So, thank you all for joining us today.
We have a lot to cover.

12
00:00:43,924 --> 00:00:45,937
But, before we get started,

13
00:00:45,937 --> 00:00:48,949
I had one important business
which I wanted to get over with.

14
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:51,781
Towards the end of last year,
it came to my attention

15
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:55,957
that we had a major bug
in one of our core products.

16
00:00:56,217 --> 00:00:59,293
- It turns out...
- (laughter)

17
00:00:59,697 --> 00:01:03,437
...we got the cheese wrong
in our burger emoji.

18
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:05,092
Anyway, we went hard to work.

19
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:08,204
I never knew so many people
cared about where the cheese is.

20
00:01:08,204 --> 00:01:09,762
- (laughter)
- We fixed it.

21
00:01:09,762 --> 00:01:13,703
You know, the irony of the whole thing
is I'm a vegetarian in the first place.

22
00:01:13,703 --> 00:01:16,116
(laughter and applause)

23
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:23,696
So, we fixed it--
hopefully we got the cheese right,

24
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:27,449
but as we were working on this,
this came to my attention.

25
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,340
(laughter)

26
00:01:31,996 --> 00:01:34,963
I don't even want to tell you
the explanation the team gave me

27
00:01:34,963 --> 00:01:37,425
as to why the foam
is floating above the beer.

28
00:01:37,425 --> 00:01:39,116
(laughter)

29
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,762
...but we restored
the natural laws of physics.

30
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:44,940
(laughter)

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,260
(cheering)

32
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:53,288
So, all is well.
We can get back to business.

33
00:01:53,288 --> 00:01:56,631
We can talk about all the progress
since last year's I/O.

34
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,241
I'm sure all of you would agree

35
00:01:59,241 --> 00:02:02,252
it's been an extraordinary year
on many fronts.

36
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:04,026
I'm sure you've all felt it.

37
00:02:04,206 --> 00:02:07,416
We're at an important inflection point
in computing.

38
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:10,785
And it's exciting
to be driving technology forward.

39
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:15,909
And it's made us even more reflective
about our responsibilities.

40
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:19,758
Expectations for technology vary greatly,

41
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:22,616
depending on where you are in the world,

42
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:25,170
or what opportunities are available to you.

43
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,794
For someone like me,
who grew up without a phone,

44
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,588
I can distinctly remember

45
00:02:30,588 --> 00:02:34,671
how gaining access to technology
can make a difference in your life.

46
00:02:35,771 --> 00:02:38,833
And we see this in the work we do
around the world.

47
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:44,137
You see it when someone gets access
to a smartphone for the first time.

48
00:02:45,412 --> 00:02:49,093
And you can feel it in the huge demand
for digital skills we see.

49
00:02:50,276 --> 00:02:53,575
That's why we've been so focused
on bringing digital skills

50
00:02:53,575 --> 00:02:56,565
to communities around the world.

51
00:02:56,565 --> 00:03:00,505
So far, we have trained 
over 25 million people

52
00:03:00,505 --> 00:03:03,542
and we expect that number
to rise over 60 million

53
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,327
in the next five years.

54
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:10,141
It's clear technology can be 
a positive force.

55
00:03:10,961 --> 00:03:14,394
But it's equally clear
that we just can't be wide-eyed

56
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:16,963
about the innovations technology creates.

57
00:03:17,952 --> 00:03:22,608
There are very real
and important questions being raised

58
00:03:22,608 --> 00:03:25,056
about the impact of these advances

59
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,002
and the role they'll play in our lives.

60
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:32,692
So, we know the path ahead
needs to be navigated carefully

61
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:33,835
and deliberately.

62
00:03:34,292 --> 00:03:38,358
And we feel a deep sense of responsibility
to get this right.

63
00:03:39,484 --> 00:03:42,643
That's the spirit with which
we're approaching our core mission--

64
00:03:42,643 --> 00:03:45,209
to make information more useful,

65
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:48,247
accessible, and beneficial to society.

66
00:03:48,872 --> 00:03:51,617
I've always felt
that we were fortunate as a company

67
00:03:51,617 --> 00:03:53,353
to have a timeless mission

68
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:56,930
that feels as relevant today
as when we started.

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,699
We're excited about how
we're going to approach our mission

70
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:02,102
with renewed vigor,

71
00:04:02,102 --> 00:04:04,797
thanks to the progress we see in AI.

72
00:04:04,797 --> 00:04:08,535
AI is enabling for us to do this in new ways,

73
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:12,156
solving problems for our users
around the world.

74
00:04:13,426 --> 00:04:16,574
Last year, at Google I/O,
we announced Google AI.

75
00:04:17,077 --> 00:04:19,779
It's a collection of our teams and efforts

76
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:22,635
to bring the benefits of AI to everyone.

77
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:26,030
And we want this to work globally,

78
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,847
so we are opening AI centers 
around the world.

79
00:04:29,987 --> 00:04:32,777
AI is going to impact many, many fields.

80
00:04:32,777 --> 00:04:35,246
I want to give you 
a couple of examples today.

81
00:04:35,954 --> 00:04:40,149
Healthcare is one of the most
important fields AI is going to transform.

82
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:45,527
Last year we announced our work
on diabetic retinopathy.

83
00:04:45,527 --> 00:04:47,583
This is a leading cause of blindness,

84
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:51,284
and we used deep learning
to help doctors diagnose it earlier.

85
00:04:51,795 --> 00:04:54,613
And we've been
running field trials since then

86
00:04:54,613 --> 00:04:57,520
at Aravind and Sankara hospitals in India,

87
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,191
and the field trials are going really well.

88
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,721
We are bringing expert diagnosis to places

89
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:06,356
where trained doctors are scarce.

90
00:05:07,406 --> 00:05:11,330
It turned out, using the same retinal scans,

91
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,883
there were things which humans
quite didn't know to look for,

92
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:17,883
but our AI systems offered more insights.

93
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,966
Your same eye scan,

94
00:05:19,966 --> 00:05:22,340
it turns out, holds information

95
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,263
with which we can predict the five-year risk

96
00:05:26,263 --> 00:05:29,188
of you having an adverse
cardiovascular event--

97
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,915
heart attack or strokes.

98
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:33,781
So, to me, the interesting thing is that,

99
00:05:33,781 --> 00:05:36,758
more than what doctors
could find in these eye scans,

100
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:40,006
the machine learning systems
offered newer insights.

101
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,815
This could be the basis
for a new, non-invasive way

102
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:46,457
to detect cardiovascular risk.

103
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:48,903
And we're working--
we just published the research--

104
00:05:48,903 --> 00:05:51,202
and we're going to be working
to bring this to field trials

105
00:05:51,202 --> 00:05:52,924
with our partners.

106
00:05:54,064 --> 00:05:56,192
Another area where AI can help

107
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:59,510
is to actually help doctors
predict medical events.

108
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,071
It turns out, doctors have a lot
of difficult decisions to make,

109
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:06,269
and for them, getting advanced notice--

110
00:06:06,269 --> 00:06:12,457
say, 24-48 hours before
a patient is likely to get very sick--

111
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:15,368
has a tremendous difference in the outcome.

112
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:18,717
And so, we put
our machine learning systems to work.

113
00:06:18,717 --> 00:06:20,499
We've been working with our partners

114
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:23,837
using de-identified medical records.

115
00:06:23,837 --> 00:06:28,634
And it turns out if you go and analyze
over 100,000 data points per patient--

116
00:06:28,634 --> 00:06:31,425
more than any single doctor could analyze--

117
00:06:31,425 --> 00:06:34,743
we can actually quantitatively predict

118
00:06:34,743 --> 00:06:36,666
the chance of readmission,

119
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:40,928
24-48 hours earlier than traditional methods.

120
00:06:40,928 --> 00:06:43,880
It gives doctors more time to act.

121
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:47,091
We are publishing our paper 
on this later today

122
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:51,251
and we're looking forward to partnering
with hospitals and medical institutions.

123
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:57,007
Another area where AI can help
is accessibility.

124
00:06:57,927 --> 00:07:02,058
You know, we can make day-to-day use cases
much easier for people.

125
00:07:02,058 --> 00:07:04,563
Let's take a common use case.

126
00:07:05,253 --> 00:07:08,428
You come back home at night
and you turn your TV on.

127
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,642
It's not that uncommon
to see two or more people

128
00:07:11,642 --> 00:07:14,247
passionately talking over each other.

129
00:07:14,247 --> 00:07:16,374
Imagine if you're hearing impaired

130
00:07:16,374 --> 00:07:19,906
and you're relying on closed captioning
to understand what's going on.

131
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,627
This is how it looks to you.

132
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:25,185
(two men talking over each other)

133
00:07:29,254 --> 00:07:33,634
As you can see, it's gibberish--
you can't make sense of what's going on.

134
00:07:33,634 --> 00:07:37,160
So, we have machine learning technology
called <i>looking to listen</i>.

135
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,902
It not only looks for audio cues,

136
00:07:40,902 --> 00:07:43,236
but combines it with visual cues

137
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:45,912
to clearly disambiguate the two voices.

138
00:07:45,912 --> 00:07:48,589
Let's see how that can work,
maybe, in YouTube.

139
00:07:48,589 --> 00:07:50,769
(man on right)
He's not on a Danny Ainge level.

140
00:07:50,769 --> 00:07:52,884
But, he's above a Colangelo level.

141
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:54,861
In other words,
he understands enough to...

142
00:07:55,341 --> 00:07:58,264
(man on left) You said
it was alright to lose on purpose.

143
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:00,565
You said it's alright to lose on purpose,

144
00:08:00,565 --> 00:08:02,203
and advertise that to the fans.

145
00:08:02,203 --> 00:08:05,028
It's perfectly okay.
You said it's okay!

146
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:06,882
We have nothing else to talk about!

147
00:08:07,202 --> 00:08:09,812
(Sundar) We have a lot to talk about.
(chuckles)

148
00:08:09,812 --> 00:08:11,106
(laughter)

149
00:08:11,106 --> 00:08:12,391
(cheering)

150
00:08:14,898 --> 00:08:17,206
But you can see
how we can put technology to work

151
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:20,342
to make an important
day-to-day use case profoundly better.

152
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:24,796
The great thing about technology
is it's constantly evolving.

153
00:08:25,156 --> 00:08:28,031
In fact, we can even apply machine learning

154
00:08:28,031 --> 00:08:31,587
to a 200-year old technology-- Morse code--

155
00:08:31,587 --> 00:08:34,472
and make an impact
on someone's quality of life.

156
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,715
Let's take a look.

157
00:08:37,765 --> 00:08:40,134

<i>and partner in crime.</i>

173
00:09:28,593 --> 00:09:31,337
It's always been very, very difficult

174
00:09:31,337 --> 00:09:33,554
just to find Morse code devices,

175
00:09:33,554 --> 00:09:35,250
to try Morse code.

176
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:38,064
(Tania) <i>This is why I had to create my own.</i>

177
00:09:38,064 --> 00:09:40,662
<i>With the help from Ken, I have a voice,</i>

178
00:09:40,662 --> 00:09:43,711
<i>and more independence in my daily life.</i>

179
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:46,090
<i>But most people don't have Ken.</i>

180
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,540
<i>It is our hope that we can collaborate
with the Gboard team</i>

181
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,898
<i>to help people who want to tap into
the freedom of using Morse code.</i>

182
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:58,323
(woman) Gboard is the Google keyboard.

183
00:09:58,323 --> 00:10:00,855
What we have discovered, working on Gboard,

184
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:04,556
is that there are entire pockets
of populations in the world--

185
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:07,509
and when I say "pockets"
it's like tens of millions of people--

186
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:11,688
who have never had access to a keyboard
that works in their own language.

187
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:15,816
With Tania, we've built support
in Gboard for Morse code.

188
00:10:15,816 --> 00:10:17,431
So, it's an input modality

189
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,480
that allows you
to type in Morse code and get text out

190
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,620
with predictions, suggestions.

191
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,782
I think it's a beautiful example
of where machine learning

192
00:10:26,782 --> 00:10:30,492
can really assist someone
in a way that a normal keyboard,

193
00:10:30,492 --> 00:10:32,245
without artificial intelligence,

194
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:33,962
wouldn't be able to.

195
00:10:33,962 --> 00:10:37,362
(Tania) <i>I am very excited
to continue on this journey.</i>

196
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,897
<i>Many, many people will benefit from this</i>

197
00:10:39,897 --> 00:10:42,896
<i>and that thrills me to no end.</i>

198
00:10:42,896 --> 00:10:45,413
♪ (music) ♪

199
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:51,393
(applause)

200
00:10:56,492 --> 00:10:58,298
It's a very inspiring story.

201
00:10:58,298 --> 00:11:02,191
We're very, very excited
to have Tania and Ken join us today.

202
00:11:02,191 --> 00:11:04,322
(cheering)

203
00:11:29,036 --> 00:11:31,203
Tania and Ken are actually developers.

204
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,552
They really worked with our team

205
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:36,556
to harness the power
of actually predictive suggestions

206
00:11:36,556 --> 00:11:40,610
in Gboard, in the context of Morse code.

207
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,923
I'm really excited
that Gboard with Morse code

208
00:11:42,923 --> 00:11:45,097
is available in beta later today.

209
00:11:45,677 --> 00:11:48,588
It's great to reinvent products with AI.

210
00:11:48,588 --> 00:11:51,374
Gboard is actually a great example of it.

211
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:52,846
Every single day,

212
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:57,538
we offer users-- and users choose--
over 8 billion auto correction

213
00:11:57,538 --> 00:11:59,058
each and every day.

214
00:12:00,008 --> 00:12:03,470
Another example of one of our core products

215
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,283
which we are redesigning with AI

216
00:12:05,283 --> 00:12:06,894
is Gmail.

217
00:12:06,894 --> 00:12:09,676
We just had a new, fresher look for Gmail--

218
00:12:09,676 --> 00:12:11,102
a recent redesign.

219
00:12:11,102 --> 00:12:13,307
I hope you're all enjoying using it.

220
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:15,748
We're bringing another feature to Gmail.

221
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:18,958
We call it Smart Compose.

222
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,349
So, as the name suggests,

223
00:12:21,349 --> 00:12:26,571
we use machine learning
to start suggesting phrases for you

224
00:12:26,571 --> 00:12:27,757
as you type.

225
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,257
All you need to do is to hit Tab
and keep auto-completing.

226
00:12:32,257 --> 00:12:34,561
(applause)

227
00:12:38,492 --> 00:12:42,097
In this case, it understands
the subject is "Taco Tuesday."

228
00:12:42,097 --> 00:12:45,194
It suggests chips, salsa, guacamole.

229
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:49,596
It takes care
of mundane things like addresses

230
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,412
so you don't need to worry about it--

231
00:12:51,412 --> 00:12:53,974
you can actually focus
on what you want to type.

232
00:12:53,974 --> 00:12:55,749
I've been loving using it.

233
00:12:55,749 --> 00:12:58,211
I've been sending
a lot more emails to the company...

234
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,951
- ...not sure what the company thinks of it.
- (laughter)

235
00:13:00,951 --> 00:13:02,128
But it's been great.

236
00:13:02,128 --> 00:13:05,500
We are rolling out Smart Compose
to all our users this month

237
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,557
and hope you enjoy using it as well.

238
00:13:07,557 --> 00:13:09,666
(applause)

239
00:13:12,498 --> 00:13:16,706
Another product,
which we built from the ground up using AI

240
00:13:16,706 --> 00:13:17,922
is Google Photos.

241
00:13:18,618 --> 00:13:20,766
Works amazingly well,

242
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:22,430
and it scales.

243
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,888
If you click on one of these photos,

244
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:26,920
what we call the "photo viewer experience"

245
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,401
where you're looking at one photo at a time,

246
00:13:29,401 --> 00:13:31,547
so that you understand the scale.

247
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:37,229
Every single day there are
over 5 billion photos viewed by our users,

248
00:13:37,229 --> 00:13:38,765
each and every day.

249
00:13:38,765 --> 00:13:42,826
So, we want to use the AI
to help in those moments.

250
00:13:42,826 --> 00:13:47,418
We are bringing a new feature
called Suggested Actions--

251
00:13:47,418 --> 00:13:49,804
essentially suggesting small actions

252
00:13:49,804 --> 00:13:52,136
right in context for you to act on.

253
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:55,233
Say, for example, you went to a wedding

254
00:13:55,233 --> 00:13:57,484
and you're looking through those pictures.

255
00:13:57,484 --> 00:14:00,243
We understand your friend, Lisa,
is in the picture,

256
00:14:00,243 --> 00:14:03,114
and we offer to the share
the three photos with Lisa,

257
00:14:03,114 --> 00:14:06,757
and with one click
those photos can be sent to her.

258
00:14:06,757 --> 00:14:10,358
So, the anxiety where everyone is trying
to get the picture on their phone,

259
00:14:10,358 --> 00:14:12,347
I think we can make that better.

260
00:14:12,897 --> 00:14:15,512
Say, for example,
if the photo-- in the same wedding--

261
00:14:15,512 --> 00:14:17,470
if the photos are underexposed,

262
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:20,065
our AI systems offer a suggestion

263
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:23,604
to fix the brightness right there, one tap,

264
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:26,087
and we can fix the brightness for you.

265
00:14:26,677 --> 00:14:30,855
Or, if you took a picture of a document
which you want to save for later,

266
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:35,061
we can recognize,
convert the document to PDF,

267
00:14:35,061 --> 00:14:37,950
- and make it...
- (cheering)

268
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,060
...make it much easier for you to use later.

269
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,290
We want to make
all these simple cases delightful.

270
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,841
By the way,
AI can also deliver unexpected moments.

271
00:14:53,401 --> 00:14:57,335
So, for example,
if you have this cute picture of your kid,

272
00:14:57,335 --> 00:14:59,079
we can make it better--

273
00:14:59,079 --> 00:15:02,291
we can drop the background color,
pop the color,

274
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,087
and make the kid even cuter.

275
00:15:04,087 --> 00:15:06,326
(cheering)

276
00:15:07,316 --> 00:15:10,088
Or, if you happen to have
a very special memory,

277
00:15:10,088 --> 00:15:14,039
something in black and white--
maybe of your mother and grandmother--

278
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:16,896
we can recreate that moment in color

279
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:20,851
and make that moment
even more real and special.

280
00:15:20,851 --> 00:15:23,459
(cheering)

281
00:15:25,505 --> 00:15:29,094
All these features are going to be
rolling out to Google Photos users

282
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,134
in the next couple of months.

283
00:15:31,134 --> 00:15:33,643
The reason we are able to do this

284
00:15:33,643 --> 00:15:36,225
is because, for a while,
we have been investing

285
00:15:36,225 --> 00:15:39,098
in the scale
of our computational architecture.

286
00:15:39,658 --> 00:15:43,863
This is why last year we talked 
about our Tensor Processing Units.

287
00:15:43,863 --> 00:15:46,681
These are special purpose
machine learning chips.

288
00:15:47,497 --> 00:15:51,305
These are driving all the product
improvements you're seeing today.

289
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:54,064
And we have made it available
to our Cloud customers.

290
00:15:54,684 --> 00:15:57,229
Since the last year, we've been hard at work,

291
00:15:57,229 --> 00:16:02,556
and today, I'm excited to announce
our next generation TPU 3.0.

292
00:16:02,936 --> 00:16:04,981
(cheering)

293
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:09,778
These chips are so powerful
that for the first time

294
00:16:09,778 --> 00:16:13,010
we've had to introduce
liquid cooling in our data centers.

295
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,784
(cheering)

296
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:17,938
And we put these chips
in the form of giant pods.

297
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:22,925
Each of these pods is now 8x
more powerful than last year--

298
00:16:22,925 --> 00:16:24,825
it's well over 100 pedaflops.

299
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:28,100
And this is what allows us
to develop better models,

300
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:31,652
larger models, more accurate models,

301
00:16:31,652 --> 00:16:34,853
and helps us tackle even bigger problems.

302
00:16:35,773 --> 00:16:39,025
And one of the biggest problems
we're tackling with AI

303
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,686
is the Google Assistant.

304
00:16:41,536 --> 00:16:43,600
Our vision for the perfect Assistant

305
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,295
is that it's naturally conversational,

306
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:47,802
it's there when you need it

307
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,541
so that you can get things done
in the real world.

308
00:16:51,089 --> 00:16:53,876
And we are working to make it even better.

309
00:16:53,876 --> 00:16:58,560
We want the Assistant to be something
that's natural and comfortable to talk to.

310
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,904
And to do that,

311
00:16:59,904 --> 00:17:03,067
we need to start with the foundation
of the Google Assistant--

312
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:04,394
the voice.

313
00:17:04,394 --> 00:17:07,525
Today, that's how most users
interact with the Assistant.

314
00:17:08,494 --> 00:17:11,415
Our current voice is code-named "Holly."

315
00:17:11,415 --> 00:17:15,523
She was a real person.
She spent months in our studio.

316
00:17:15,523 --> 00:17:18,940
And then we stitched
those recordings together to create Voice.

317
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,228
But 18 months ago,

318
00:17:21,229 --> 00:17:24,200
we announced a breakthrough
from our DeepMind team

319
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,036
called WaveNet.

320
00:17:26,036 --> 00:17:27,930
Unlike the current systems,

321
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:30,703
WaveNet actually models
the underlying raw audio

322
00:17:30,703 --> 00:17:32,859
to create a more natural voice.

323
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:36,085
It's closer to how humans speak--

324
00:17:36,085 --> 00:17:38,163
the pitch, the pace,

325
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:41,093
even all the pauses, that convey meaning.

326
00:17:41,093 --> 00:17:43,411
We want to get all of that right.

327
00:17:43,411 --> 00:17:45,758
So, we've worked hard with WaveNet,

328
00:17:45,758 --> 00:17:48,088
and we are adding, as of today,

329
00:17:48,088 --> 00:17:51,159
six new voices to the Google Assistant.

330
00:17:51,159 --> 00:17:53,211
Let's have them say hello.

331
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,505
(voice #1) <i>Good morning, everyone.</i>

332
00:17:55,505 --> 00:17:57,922
(voice #2) <i>I'm your Google Assistant.</i>

333
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,264
(voice #3) <i>Welcome
to Shoreline Amphitheatre.</i>

334
00:18:00,264 --> 00:18:03,429
(voice #4)<i>
We hope you'll enjoy Google I/O.</i>

335
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:05,361
(voice #5) <i>Back to you, Sundar.</i>

336
00:18:06,671 --> 00:18:08,912
(applause)

337
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:12,986
Our goal is, one day,

338
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:17,608
to get the right accents, languages,
and dialects right, globally.

339
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:20,077
WaveNet can make this much easier.

340
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:21,576
With this technology,

341
00:18:21,576 --> 00:18:25,465
we started wondering
who we could get into the studio

342
00:18:25,465 --> 00:18:27,312
with an amazing voice.

343
00:18:27,312 --> 00:18:28,484
Take a look.

344
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:30,275
Couscous:

345
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,808
A type of North African
semolina and granules

346
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,995
made from crushed durum wheat.

347
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,856

348
00:18:38,586 --> 00:18:43,120
I want a puppy with sweet eyes
and a fluffy tail who likes my haikus.

00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,294

He would probably tell you
he don't want to brag

355
00:19:01,777 --> 00:19:04,567
but he'll be the best assistant
you ever had.

356
00:19:04,567 --> 00:19:06,570
(man) <i>Can you tell me where you live?</i>

357
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,956
You can find me on all kinds of devices--

358
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:12,888
phones, Google Homes, and, if I'm lucky...

359
00:19:13,448 --> 00:19:14,808

361
00:19:21,183 --> 00:19:24,315
That's right-- John Legend's voice
is coming to the Assistant.

362
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:26,744
Clearly, he didn't
spend all the time in the studio

363
00:19:26,744 --> 00:19:30,077
answering every possible question
that you could ask.

364
00:19:30,077 --> 00:19:33,385
But WaveNet allowed us
to shorten the studio time,

365
00:19:33,385 --> 00:19:37,032
and the model can actually
capture the richness of his voice.

366
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:40,941
His voice will be coming later this year
in certain contexts

367
00:19:40,941 --> 00:19:43,392
so that you can get responses like this:

368
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,155
(John Legend's voice)<i>
Good morning, Sundar.</i>

369
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:48,516
<i>Right now, in Mountain View,
it's 65 with clear skies.</i>

370
00:19:48,516 --> 00:19:52,122
<i>Today, it's predicted
to be 75 degrees and sunny.</i>

371
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:55,510
<i>At 10 a.m. you have an event
called Google I/O Keynote.</i>

372
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,686
- <i>Then, at 1 p.m. you have margaritas.</i>
- (laughter)

373
00:19:58,686 --> 00:20:00,226
<i>Have a wonderful day.</i>

374
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,475
I'm looking forward to 1 p.m.

375
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:04,062
(laughter)

376
00:20:04,062 --> 00:20:06,365
So, John's voice is coming later this year.

377
00:20:06,365 --> 00:20:10,533
I'm really excited we can
drive advances like this with AI.

378
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,309
We are doing a lot more
with the Google Assistant.

379
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:15,474
And, to talk to you a little more about it,

380
00:20:15,474 --> 00:20:17,501
let me invite Scott onto the stage.

381
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,233
Hey Google. Call Maddie.

382
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:21,817
(Assistant) <i>Okay, dialing now.</i>

383
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:23,392
Hey Google. Book a table for four.

384
00:20:23,392 --> 00:20:24,738

00:20:24,738 --> 00:20:26,084
Hey Google. Call my brother.

386
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,525
Hey Google. Call my brother.

Text Carol.

388
00:20:28,693 --> 00:20:30,239
Can you text Carol for me, too?

389
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:32,007
Hey Google. Who just texted me?

390
00:20:32,007 --> 00:20:33,515
- Yo Google.
- (man) <i>Cut!</i>

391
00:20:33,515 --> 00:20:35,083
Kevin, that was great.

392
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,094
But we haven't made "Yo Google" work yet,

393
00:20:37,094 --> 00:20:38,512
so you have to say "Hey".

394
00:20:38,512 --> 00:20:39,591

<i>Can we just get one

(cheering)

418
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,436
Two years ago

419
00:21:30,436 --> 00:21:33,778
we announced the Google Assistant
right here at I/O.

420
00:21:33,778 --> 00:21:38,799
Today, the Assistant is available
on over 500 million devices,

421
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,599
including phones, speakers, headphones,

422
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,039
TVs, watches, and more.

423
00:21:44,829 --> 00:21:48,974
It's available in cars
for more than 40 auto brands,

424
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:53,287
and it works with over 
5,000 connected home devices,

425
00:21:53,287 --> 00:21:56,136
from dishwashers to doorbells.

426
00:21:56,806 --> 00:22:00,295
People around the world
are using it every single day.

427
00:22:00,295 --> 00:22:04,079
For example, we launched the Assistant
in India last year,

428
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:07,073
and the response has been incredible.

429
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:10,768
Daily usage there has tripled
since the beginning of the year.

430
00:22:11,688 --> 00:22:13,186
By the end of this year,

431
00:22:13,186 --> 00:22:15,398
the Assistant will support 30 languages

432
00:22:15,398 --> 00:22:18,115
and be available in 80 countries.

433
00:22:18,115 --> 00:22:19,893
So, we've made great progress.

434
00:22:19,893 --> 00:22:21,947
But we're just getting started.

435
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:25,114
Today, we're going to share with you
some important ways

436
00:22:25,114 --> 00:22:28,600
that the Assistant is becoming 
more naturally conversational

437
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,271
and visually assistive,

438
00:22:30,271 --> 00:22:33,306
in order to help you do more
and get time back.

439
00:22:34,146 --> 00:22:35,615
Now, as you heard from Sundar,

440
00:22:35,615 --> 00:22:39,395
new voices that you can choose from
to make the Google Assistant your own

441
00:22:39,395 --> 00:22:41,031
are an important aspect

442
00:22:41,031 --> 00:22:44,944
of making the conversation
with your Assistant more natural.

443
00:22:44,944 --> 00:22:47,370
But to be a great conversation partner,

444
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,666
the Assistant needs to deeply understand
the social dynamics of conversation.

445
00:22:52,666 --> 00:22:54,965
For example, let's be honest,

446
00:22:54,965 --> 00:22:58,382
it gets a little annoying
to say, "Hey Google"

447
00:22:58,382 --> 00:23:01,031
every time
I want to get my Assistant's attention.

448
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:04,112
This grandma,
who you might have seen on YouTube,

449
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,860
was definitely feeling that way.

450
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,544
- (woman) Googoo!
- (laughter)

451
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,950
Hey Googoo!

452
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,046
Googoo!
Hello Googoo!

453
00:23:12,046 --> 00:23:14,606
- (slowly) H-e-y Googoo.
- (laughter)

454
00:23:15,146 --> 00:23:16,449
Okay Googoo.

455
00:23:16,449 --> 00:23:19,478
- He wanna know what is the weather...
- (man) Tomorrow.

456
00:23:19,478 --> 00:23:20,965
(woman) Tomorrow.

457
00:23:21,645 --> 00:23:23,663
(Assistant) <i>In Flagler Beach tomorrow,</i>

458
00:23:23,663 --> 00:23:27,036
<i>there'll be showers
with a high of 65 and a low of 56.</i>

459
00:23:27,036 --> 00:23:28,629

460
00:23:29,529 --> 00:23:32,086
- (Scott laughing)
- (laughter)

461
00:23:32,086 --> 00:23:34,637
Well, the Assistant
eventually worked for her.

462
00:23:34,637 --> 00:23:36,377
But, it shouldn't be so hard.

463
00:23:36,377 --> 00:23:39,620
Now you won't have to say,
"Hey Google" every time.

464
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,889
Check this out.

465
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:42,834
Hey Google.
Did the Warriors win?

466
00:23:44,064 --> 00:23:46,487
(Assistant) <i>Yes,
the Warriors won 118 to 92</i>

467
00:23:46,487 --> 00:23:48,464
<i>last Sunday against the Pelicans.</i>

468
00:23:48,464 --> 00:23:51,045
(Scott) Nice!
When's their next game?

469
00:23:52,115 --> 00:23:54,756
(Assistant) <i>The Warriors' next game
is today at 7:30 pm</i>

470
00:23:54,756 --> 00:23:56,833
<i>where they will be playing the Pelicans.</i>

471
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:59,357
(Scott) Great.
It's going to be fun to watch tonight.

472
00:23:59,357 --> 00:24:02,456
Hey, remind me to find
my Kevin Durant jersey when I get home.

473
00:24:02,456 --> 00:24:05,329
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
I'll remind you when you get home.</i>

474
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:09,792
Now, notice that I was able to have
a natural, back-and-forth conversation

475
00:24:09,792 --> 00:24:10,803
with my Assistant,

476
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:15,174
without having to repeat "Hey Google"
for every followup request.

477
00:24:15,174 --> 00:24:16,363
Even more helpful--

478
00:24:16,363 --> 00:24:19,883
my Assistant could understand
when I was talking to it

479
00:24:19,883 --> 00:24:21,794
versus when I was talking to all of you.

480
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:25,224
We call this Continued Conversation

481
00:24:25,224 --> 00:24:27,418
and it's been a top feature request.

482
00:24:27,418 --> 00:24:29,742
You'll be able to turn it on
in the coming weeks.

483
00:24:31,042 --> 00:24:33,142
(applause)

484
00:24:35,671 --> 00:24:38,254
So, let's say it's almost game time.

485
00:24:38,254 --> 00:24:39,253
Hey Google.

486
00:24:39,253 --> 00:24:41,900
Turn on the Warriors game
and start the popcorn maker.

487
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,308
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
Here's the Golden State Warriors game</i>

488
00:24:44,308 --> 00:24:47,321
<i>on YouTube TV
and turning the popcorn maker on.</i>

489
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,968
(Scott) Oh, and can you dim the lights
in the family room and in the kitchen?

490
00:24:51,478 --> 00:24:55,018
(Assistant) <i>Sure. Dimming the lights
in the family room and in the kitchen.</i>

491
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,582
(Scott) Now, you'll notice
in both of these examples

492
00:24:57,582 --> 00:24:59,807
I asked for multiple things at once--

493
00:24:59,807 --> 00:25:02,073
something
that feels really natural for us,

494
00:25:02,073 --> 00:25:04,661
but it's very difficult
for computers to understand.

495
00:25:05,431 --> 00:25:07,925
It's something we call Multiple Actions

496
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:10,706
and we're rolling out this capability
in the Assistant now.

497
00:25:11,006 --> 00:25:15,243
You might think, "Come on, it's easy!
Just look for the 'and'."

498
00:25:15,243 --> 00:25:16,553
(laughter)

499
00:25:16,553 --> 00:25:19,961
But it's not always so straightforward.

500
00:25:19,961 --> 00:25:23,771
In this example,
even though it has the word "and,"

501
00:25:23,771 --> 00:25:27,027
it's not two requests--
it's actually just one.

502
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,230
But here,

503
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,331
even though it looks very similar,

504
00:25:31,331 --> 00:25:33,311
the Assistant has to break it apart

505
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,225
to form the two requests.

506
00:25:35,225 --> 00:25:38,067
In linguistics it's called
"coordination reduction."

507
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:41,666
Multiple actions
can get way more complicated

508
00:25:41,666 --> 00:25:43,055
so, just for fun--

509
00:25:43,055 --> 00:25:44,208
Hey Google.

510
00:25:44,208 --> 00:25:48,054
Who was the governor of California
when Kevin Durant was drafted,

511
00:25:48,054 --> 00:25:50,056
and what team drafted him?

512
00:25:51,256 --> 00:25:54,406
(Assistant) <i>Arnold Schwarzenegger
was the governor in 2007.</i>

513
00:25:54,406 --> 00:25:57,346
<i>Kevin Durant was drafted
by the Seattle Super Sonics.</i>

514
00:25:58,136 --> 00:26:00,478
(Scott) Alright.
Just in case you were wondering.

515
00:26:00,478 --> 00:26:02,069
(applause)

516
00:26:03,223 --> 00:26:04,236
Alright.

517
00:26:05,476 --> 00:26:06,501
Next.

518
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,799
We've also been working on

519
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:10,459
improving the conversation
with the Google Assistant

520
00:26:10,459 --> 00:26:11,871
for families.

521
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,653
Last fall, we launched our Family experience

522
00:26:14,653 --> 00:26:15,877
for the Google Assistant.

523
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:19,991
It provides family-friendly games,
activities, and stories.

524
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:22,091
We've continued to grow our library,

525
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:26,944
and families have listened to
over 130,000 hours of children's stories

526
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,021
in the last two months alone.

527
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:32,049
Now, as we continue
to improve the experience for families,

528
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,518
a concern that we've heard 
from many parents--

529
00:26:34,518 --> 00:26:36,980
including people on the team
who have children--

530
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,447
is are kids learning
to be bossy and demanding

531
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:43,940
when they can just say, "Hey Google"
to ask for anything they need?

532
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:45,850
It's not a simple area,

533
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:49,693
but one step that we've been working on
is something we call "Pretty Please."

534
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:52,823
Some of the parents on the team have been
testing it out with their families.

535
00:26:52,823 --> 00:26:54,049
Take a look.

536
00:26:54,449 --> 00:26:56,365
Hey Google.
Talk to [inaudible].

537
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,629
Daddy, you forgot to say please.

538
00:26:59,249 --> 00:27:01,328
Okay Google.
Please tell me a story.

539
00:27:02,158 --> 00:27:04,062
(Assistant) <i>Thanks for saying please.</i>

540
00:27:04,062 --> 00:27:06,523
Play "Freeze Dance," please.

541
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:08,329
(Assistant) <i>What a nice way to ask me.</i>

542
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,126
Tell me a story, please.

543
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:13,067
(Assistant) <i>Thanks for asking so nicely.</i>

544
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:15,271
<i>Once upon a time,
there was a wacky walrus...</i>

545
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:17,276
Please help me with my homework.

546
00:27:17,276 --> 00:27:18,352
Please...

547
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,622
- Please...
- Please...

548
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,044
(Assistant) <i>You're very polite.</i>

549
00:27:22,514 --> 00:27:23,595
I know.

550
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:24,861
♪ (music) ♪

551
00:27:24,861 --> 00:27:25,961
(laughter)

552
00:27:25,961 --> 00:27:27,969
(Scott) So, the Assistant understands

553
00:27:27,969 --> 00:27:31,798
and responds to positive conversation
with polite reinforcement.

554
00:27:31,798 --> 00:27:35,263
We've been consulting with families
and child development experts,

555
00:27:35,263 --> 00:27:39,081
and we plan to offer Pretty Please
as an option for families later this year.

556
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:43,278
So, with new voices for your Assistant,

557
00:27:43,278 --> 00:27:45,269
Continued Conversation,

558
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:47,725
Multiple Actions and Pretty Please,

559
00:27:47,725 --> 00:27:49,679
AI is helping us make big strides

560
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,667
so everyone can have
a more natural conversation

561
00:27:52,667 --> 00:27:54,129
with their Assistant.

562
00:27:54,429 --> 00:27:56,200
And now I'd like to introduce Lilian,

563
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,756
who's going to share
some exciting things we're doing,

564
00:27:58,756 --> 00:28:01,846
bringing Voice
and Visual Assistance together.

565
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:04,674
♪ (music) ♪

566
00:28:10,262 --> 00:28:12,873
Well, thanks Scott,
and good morning everyone.

567
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:16,200
Over the last couple of years
the Assistant has been focused

568
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,481
on the verbal conversation
that you can have with Google.

569
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,238
Today, we're going to unveil
a new visual canvas

570
00:28:22,238 --> 00:28:24,537
for the Google Assistant across screens.

571
00:28:24,537 --> 00:28:28,658
This will bring the simplicity of Voice
together with a rich visual experience.

572
00:28:28,658 --> 00:28:30,381
I'm going to invite Meggy to come up

573
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:33,182
because we're going to be switching
to a lot of live demos.

574
00:28:33,492 --> 00:28:36,167
We gave you an early look
at our new Smart Displays

575
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:38,263
at CES in January.

576
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:41,530
We're working with some of the best
consumer electronic brands,

577
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:44,700
and today I'm excited to announce
that the first Smart Displays

578
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:47,080
will go on sale in July.

579
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,985
Today, I'll show you some of the ways
that this new device

580
00:28:50,985 --> 00:28:52,436
can make your day easier,

581
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,497
by bringing the simplicity of Voice

582
00:28:54,497 --> 00:28:56,690
with the glanceability of a touch screen.

583
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,800
Let's switch over to the live demos.

584
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:02,963
Now, this is one
of the Lenovo Smart Displays.

585
00:29:02,963 --> 00:29:05,517
The ambient screen
integrates with Google Photos

586
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:09,227
and greets me with pictures of my kids,
Bella and Hudson-- those are really my kids.

587
00:29:10,065 --> 00:29:12,443
Best way to start my day every morning.

588
00:29:12,443 --> 00:29:15,088
Because the device is controlled by voice,

589
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:18,728
I can watch videos or live TV
with just a simple command.

590
00:29:18,728 --> 00:29:21,432
This makes it so easy
to enjoy my favorite shows

591
00:29:21,432 --> 00:29:23,562
while multitasking around the house.

592
00:29:23,932 --> 00:29:26,366
Hey Google.
Let's watch Jimmy Kimmel Live.

593
00:29:27,836 --> 00:29:30,277
(Assistant) <i>Okay,
playing Jimmy Kimmel Live</i>

594
00:29:30,277 --> 00:29:31,498
<i>on YouTube TV.</i>

595
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:39,318
(applause coming via the device)

596
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:43,228
(Jimmy) <i>I had a funny thing happen.
Here's something from my life--</i>

597
00:29:43,228 --> 00:29:45,647
<i>I was driving my daughter
to school this morning...</i>

598
00:29:46,397 --> 00:29:47,529
(Lilian) That's right.

599
00:29:47,529 --> 00:29:51,878
On YouTube TV you will be able
to watch all of these amazing shows,

600
00:29:51,878 --> 00:29:53,940
from local news, live sports,
and much more,

601
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,252
and they will be available
on Smart Displays.

602
00:29:57,202 --> 00:30:00,712
Now, of course you can also enjoy
all the normal content from YouTube,

603
00:30:00,712 --> 00:30:03,780
including How-to videos, music,
and original shows,

604
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:05,598
like the brand new series <i>Cobra Kai</i>

605
00:30:05,598 --> 00:30:09,014
which we started binge watching this week
because it's so good. (laughs)

606
00:30:09,584 --> 00:30:13,180
Now, cooking is another instance
where the blend of voice and visuals

607
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,785
is incredibly useful.

608
00:30:14,785 --> 00:30:18,255
Nick and I are always looking
for simple family-friendly recipes.

609
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:20,054
Hey Google.

610
00:30:20,054 --> 00:30:22,155
Show me recipes for pizza bombs.

611
00:30:23,205 --> 00:30:24,787
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
Here are some recipes.</i>

612
00:30:24,787 --> 00:30:27,493
(Lilian) So we can choose the first one
from Tasty-- that looks good.

613
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,184
You see the recipe details come right up
and we can just tap to start cooking.

614
00:30:31,184 --> 00:30:33,354
(Assistant) <i>Sure, here's Tasty.</i>

615
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:37,750
So, seeing a video demonstration
along with spoken instructions

616
00:30:37,750 --> 00:30:39,747
is a total game changer for cooking,

617
00:30:39,747 --> 00:30:42,011
especially when you have your hands full.

618
00:30:42,011 --> 00:30:43,184
Thanks, Meggy.

619
00:30:43,744 --> 00:30:46,481
(applause)

620
00:30:49,428 --> 00:30:51,789
We showed you a couple of ways
that Smart Displays

621
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,517
can make life at home easier,

622
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,323
but there are so many more,

623
00:30:55,323 --> 00:30:58,874
from staying in touch with family
with Broadcast and Dual Video Calling,

624
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:03,265
to keeping an eye on your home
with all of our other Smart Home partners,

625
00:31:03,265 --> 00:31:07,230
to seeing in advance what the morning
commute's like with Google Maps.

626
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,573
We're thoughtfully integrating
the best of Google,

627
00:31:09,573 --> 00:31:12,459
and working with developer and partners
all around the world

628
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:16,115
to bring Voice and Visuals together
in a completely new way for the home.

629
00:31:18,117 --> 00:31:21,733
Now, inspired by
the Smart Display experiences,

630
00:31:21,733 --> 00:31:24,861
we've also been working
to reimagine the Assistant experience

631
00:31:24,861 --> 00:31:27,822
on the screen
that's with us all the time--

632
00:31:27,822 --> 00:31:29,253
our mobile phones.

633
00:31:29,253 --> 00:31:32,622
I'm going to give you a sneak peak
into how the Assistant on the phone

634
00:31:32,622 --> 00:31:36,755
is becoming more immersive,
interactive, and proactive.

635
00:31:36,755 --> 00:31:38,990
So, we're going to switch
to another live demo.

636
00:31:41,814 --> 00:31:44,248
Hey Google, tell me about Camila Cabello.

637
00:31:45,838 --> 00:31:47,568
(Assistant) <i>According to Wikipedia,</i>

638
00:31:47,568 --> 00:31:51,527
<i>Karla Camila Cabello Estrabao
is an American singer and songwriter.</i>

639
00:31:51,864 --> 00:31:54,553
As you can see,
we're taking full advantage of the screen

640
00:31:54,553 --> 00:31:57,022
to give you a rich and immersive response.

641
00:31:57,022 --> 00:31:58,157
Here's another.

642
00:31:59,317 --> 00:32:00,523
Turn down the heat.

643
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:05,554
(Assistant) <i>Sure.
Cooling the living room down.</i>

644
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,966
For Smart Home requests
what you can see here

645
00:32:07,966 --> 00:32:10,774
is we're bringing the controls
right into your fingertips.

646
00:32:11,484 --> 00:32:13,127
And here's one of my favorites.

647
00:32:14,187 --> 00:32:16,428
Hey Google.
Order my usual from Starbucks.

648
00:32:19,198 --> 00:32:21,733
(Assistant) <i>Hello.
Welcome back to Starbucks.</i>

649
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,952
<i>That's one tall, non-fat latte
with caramel drizzle.</i>

650
00:32:24,952 --> 00:32:26,218
<i>Anything else?</i>

651
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:28,003
No, thanks.

652
00:32:28,003 --> 00:32:31,008
(Assistant) <i>And, are you
picking that up at the usual place?</i>

653
00:32:31,008 --> 00:32:32,385
So, I'm going to tap <i>Yes</i>.

654
00:32:33,355 --> 00:32:35,205
(Assistant) <i>Okay, your order's in.</i>

655
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:36,647
<i>See you soon.</i>

656
00:32:37,717 --> 00:32:40,556
- (applause)
- Yeah!

657
00:32:43,011 --> 00:32:45,688
We're excited to share
that we've been working with Starbucks,

658
00:32:45,688 --> 00:32:48,896
Dunkin' Donuts, DoorDash, Domino's
and many other partners

659
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:52,489
on a new food pick up and delivery
experience for the Google Assistant.

660
00:32:52,489 --> 00:32:54,746
We have already
started rolling some of these out,

661
00:32:54,746 --> 00:32:56,856
with many more partners coming soon.

662
00:32:58,626 --> 00:33:01,242
Now, rich and interactive
responses to my requests

663
00:33:01,242 --> 00:33:02,570
are really helpful,

664
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:06,706
but my ideal Assistant should also
be able to help in a proactive way.

665
00:33:06,706 --> 00:33:11,249
So, when I'm in the Assistant now,
and swipe up,

666
00:33:11,249 --> 00:33:14,471
I now get a visual snapshot of my day.

667
00:33:14,471 --> 00:33:17,730
I see helpful suggestions
based on the time, my location,

668
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,634
and even my recent interactions
with the Assistant.

669
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:25,452
I also have my reminders, packages,

670
00:33:25,452 --> 00:33:29,591
and even notes and lists,
organized and accessible right here.

671
00:33:29,591 --> 00:33:32,129
I love the convenience
of having all these details

672
00:33:32,129 --> 00:33:35,189
helpfully curated and so easy to get to.

673
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:37,679
This new visual experience for the phone

674
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,847
is thoughtfully designed
with AI at the core.

675
00:33:39,847 --> 00:33:43,498
It will launch on Android this summer,
and iOS later this year.

676
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,825
(applause)

677
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:54,272
Now, sometimes the Assistant
can actually be more helpful

678
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:56,523
by having a lower visual profile.

679
00:33:56,523 --> 00:33:59,795
So, when you're in the car,
you should stay focused on driving.

680
00:33:59,795 --> 00:34:01,732
So, let's say I'm heading home from work.

681
00:34:01,732 --> 00:34:03,965
I have Google Maps showing me
the fastest route

682
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:05,513
during rush hour traffic.

683
00:34:05,943 --> 00:34:08,891
Hey Google. Send Nick my ETA 
and play some hip-hop.

684

687
00:34:22,735 --> 00:34:25,507
So, it's so convenient
to share my ETA with my husband

688
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:27,555
with just a simple voice command.

689
00:34:27,556 --> 00:34:31,438
I'm excited to share that the Assistant
will come to navigation in Google Maps

690
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:32,674
this summer.

691
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:35,042
(applause)

692
00:34:38,295 --> 00:34:41,663
So, across Smart Displays,
phones, and in Maps,

693
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,375
this gives you a sense
of how we're making the Google Assistant

694
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:45,960
more visually assistive,

695
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,818
sensing when to respond with voice,

696
00:34:47,818 --> 00:34:50,741
and when to show a more immersive
and interactive experience.

697
00:34:51,246 --> 00:34:53,978
And with that I'll turn it 
back to Sundar. Thank you.

699
00:35:05,094 --> 00:35:06,316
Thanks, Lilian.

700
00:35:06,316 --> 00:35:08,672
It's great to see
the progress with our Assistant.

701
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,981
As I said earlier,
our vision for our Assistant

702
00:35:11,981 --> 00:35:14,206
is to help you get things done.

703
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:18,651
It turns out, a big part 
of getting things done

704
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:20,506
is making a phone call.

705
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:22,945
You may want to get an oil change schedule,

706
00:35:22,945 --> 00:35:25,197
maybe call a plumber
in the middle of the week,

707
00:35:25,197 --> 00:35:27,370
or even schedule a haircut appointment.

708
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,769
We are working hard
to help users through those moments.

709
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,814
We want to connect users
to businesses in a good way.

710
00:35:36,874 --> 00:35:39,100
Businesses actually rely a lot on this,

711
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,180
but even in the US,

712
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,886
60% of small businesses don't have
an online booking system set up.

713
00:35:46,756 --> 00:35:49,680
We think AI can help with this problem.

714
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,446
So, let's go back to this example.

715
00:35:52,446 --> 00:35:56,811
Let's say you want to ask Google
to make you a haircut appointment

716
00:35:56,811 --> 00:35:59,292
on Tuesday between 10 and noon.

717
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:02,546
What happens is the Google Assistant

718
00:36:02,546 --> 00:36:05,774
makes the call seamlessly
in the background for you.

719
00:36:06,234 --> 00:36:08,547
So, what you're going to hear

720
00:36:08,547 --> 00:36:12,164
is the Google Assistant
actually calling a real salon

721
00:36:12,164 --> 00:36:14,150
to schedule an appointment for you.

722
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,632
- (cheering)
- Let's listen.

723
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:20,040
(ringing tone)

724
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,312
(woman) <i>Hello, how can I help you?</i>

725
00:36:22,312 --> 00:36:25,509
(Assitant) <i>Hi, I'm calling
to book a women's haircut for our client.</i>

726
00:36:25,509 --> 00:36:27,527
<i>I'm looking for something on May 3rd.</i>

727
00:36:28,397 --> 00:36:30,692
(woman) <i>Sure, give me one second.</i>

728
00:36:31,172 --> 00:36:34,323
- (Assistant) <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
- (laughter)

729
00:36:34,833 --> 00:36:38,037
(woman) <i>Sure.
What time are you looking for, around?</i>

730
00:36:38,037 --> 00:36:39,321
(Assistant) <i>At 12 pm.</i>

731
00:36:39,721 --> 00:36:42,006
<i>We do not have a 12 pm available.</i>

732
00:36:42,006 --> 00:36:45,431
<i>The closest we have to that is a 1:15.</i>

733
00:36:46,101 --> 00:36:49,977
(Assistant) <i>Do you have anything
between 10 am and 12 pm?</i>

734
00:36:50,357 --> 00:36:52,852
(woman) <i>Depending on
what service she would like.</i>

735
00:36:52,852 --> 00:36:54,868
<i>What service is she looking for?</i>

736
00:36:55,398 --> 00:36:57,450
(Assistant)<i>
Just a women's haircut, for now.</i>

737
00:36:57,450 --> 00:36:59,235
(woman) <i>Okay, we have a 10 o' clock.</i>

738
00:37:00,055 --> 00:37:03,224
- (Assistant) <i>10 am is fine.</i>
- (woman) <i>Okay, what's her first name?</i>

739
00:37:03,793 --> 00:37:05,513
(Assistant)<i>
The first name is Lisa.</i>

740
00:37:06,163 --> 00:37:10,353
(woman) <i>Okay, perfect, so I will see Lisa
at 10 o' clock on May 3rd.</i>

741
00:37:10,733 --> 00:37:14,183
- (Assistant) <i>Okay great, thanks.</i>
- (woman) <i>Great, have a great day, bye.</i>

742
00:37:14,663 --> 00:37:16,462
(applause)

743
00:37:20,899 --> 00:37:23,359
That was a real call you just heard.

744
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,163
The amazing thing is the Assistant
can actually understand

745
00:37:26,163 --> 00:37:28,080
the nuances of conversation.

746
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,186
We've been working on this technology
for many years.

747
00:37:32,186 --> 00:37:33,987
It's called Google Duplex.

748
00:37:34,507 --> 00:37:37,174
It brings together
all our investments over the years

749
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:39,462
on natural language understanding,

750
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:40,796
deep learning,

751
00:37:40,796 --> 00:37:42,289
textured speech.

752
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:44,568
By the way, when we are done
the Assistant can give you

753
00:37:44,568 --> 00:37:48,188
a confirmation notification saying
your appointment has been taken care of.

754
00:37:49,258 --> 00:37:50,965
Let me give you another example.

755
00:37:50,965 --> 00:37:54,473
Let's say you want to call a restaurant,
but maybe it's a small restaurant

756
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:57,586
which is not easily available
to book online.

757
00:37:57,586 --> 00:38:00,681
The call actually
goes a bit differently than expected.

758
00:38:00,681 --> 00:38:02,186
So, take a listen.

759
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:07,197
(ringing tone)

760
00:38:07,197 --> 00:38:08,669
(woman) <i>Hi, may I help you?</i>

761
00:38:08,669 --> 00:38:12,569
(Assistant) <i>Hi, I'd like to reserve
a table for Wednesday, the 7th.</i>

762
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,275
(woman) <i>For seven people?</i>

763
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:18,282
(Assistant) <i>Um, it's for four people.</i>

764
00:38:18,982 --> 00:38:22,947
(woman) <i>Four people?
When? Today? Tonight?</i>

765
00:38:22,947 --> 00:38:24,965
(Assistant) <i>Um, next Wednesday, at 6 pm.</i>

766
00:38:26,525 --> 00:38:30,534
(woman) <i>Actually, we reserve
for upwards of five people.</i>

767
00:38:30,534 --> 00:38:32,430
<i>For four people, you can come.</i>

768
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,495
(Assistant) <i>How long is the wait
usually to be seated?</i>

769
00:38:37,045 --> 00:38:40,458
(woman) <i>For when?
Tomorrow? Or weekend, or..?</i>

770
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:44,141
(Assistant) <i>For next Wednesday,
uh, the 7th.</i>

771
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:48,310
(woman) <i>Oh no, it's not too busy.
You can come for four people, okay?</i>

772
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,816
- (Assistant) <i>Oh, I gotcha. Thanks.</i>
- (woman) <i>Yep. Bye-bye.</i>

773
00:38:52,816 --> 00:38:54,121
(laughter)

774
00:38:54,121 --> 00:38:56,001
(cheering)

775
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,178
Again, that was a real call.

776
00:39:01,178 --> 00:39:05,958
We have many of these examples,
where the calls quite don't go as expected

777
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:09,129
but the Assistant
understands the context, the nuance,

778
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:11,517
it knew to ask
for wait times in this case,

779
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:14,227
and handled the interaction gracefully.

780
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:16,988
We're still developing this technology,

781
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,487
and we actually want to work hard
to get this right--

782
00:39:19,487 --> 00:39:22,618
get the user experience
and the expectation right

783
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:24,975
for both businesses and users.

784
00:39:24,975 --> 00:39:28,521
But, done correctly,
it will save time for people,

785
00:39:28,521 --> 00:39:31,182
and generate
a lot of value for businesses.

786
00:39:31,182 --> 00:39:34,465
We really want it to work in cases, say,
if you're a busy parent in the morning

787
00:39:34,465 --> 00:39:37,574
and your kid is sick and you want to call
for a doctor's appointment.

788
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,882
So, we're going to work hard
to get this right.

789
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:44,462
There is a more straightforward case
where we can roll this out sooner,

790
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:49,018
where, for example, every single day
we get a lot of queries into Google

791
00:39:49,018 --> 00:39:51,889
where people are wondering
on the opening and closing hours

792
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,227
of businesses.

793
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,718
But it gets tricky during holidays

794
00:39:55,718 --> 00:39:57,862
and businesses get a lot of calls.

795
00:39:57,862 --> 00:40:01,524
So, we as Google,
can make just that one phone call

796
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:05,662
and then update the information
for millions of users

797
00:40:05,662 --> 00:40:10,289
and it will save a small business
countless number of calls.

798
00:40:10,289 --> 00:40:12,539
So, we're going
to get moments like this right,

799
00:40:12,539 --> 00:40:15,126
and make the experience better for users.

800
00:40:15,126 --> 00:40:19,303
This is going to be rolling out
as an experiment in the coming weeks.

801
00:40:19,303 --> 00:40:20,787
And so, stay tuned.

802
00:40:20,787 --> 00:40:23,371
(applause)

803
00:40:26,027 --> 00:40:28,461
A common theme across all this is

804
00:40:28,461 --> 00:40:31,292
we are working hard
to give users back time.

805
00:40:31,852 --> 00:40:34,875
We've always been obsessed
about that at Google.

806
00:40:34,875 --> 00:40:39,079
Search is obsessed
about getting users the answers quickly

807
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:41,640
and giving them what they want.

808
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,934
Which brings me to another area--
Digital Wellbeing.

809
00:40:46,654 --> 00:40:48,786
Based on our research,

810
00:40:48,786 --> 00:40:52,454
we know that people
feel tethered to their devices.

811
00:40:52,454 --> 00:40:55,028
I'm sure it resonates with all of you.

812
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:57,592
There is increasing social pressure

813
00:40:57,592 --> 00:40:59,895
to respond to anything you get right away.

814
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:03,203
People are anxious to stay up to date

815
00:41:03,203 --> 00:41:05,940
with all the information out there.

816
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,086
They have FOMO-- Fear of Missing Out.

817
00:41:10,376 --> 00:41:12,836
We think there's a chance
for us to do better.

818
00:41:12,836 --> 00:41:14,610
We've been talking to people,

819
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:17,835
and some people introduced to us
the concept of JOMO--

820
00:41:17,835 --> 00:41:20,263
the actual Joy of Missing Out. (chuckles)

821
00:41:20,263 --> 00:41:21,226
(laughter)

822
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:24,928
So, we think we can really help users
with digital wellbeing.

823
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:28,582
This is going to be a deep, ongoing effort

824
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:30,925
across all our products and platforms,

825
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:32,538
and we need all your help.

826
00:41:33,108 --> 00:41:36,092
We think we can help users
with their digital wellbeing

827
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:37,530
in four ways.

828
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:41,147
We want to help you
understand your habits,

829
00:41:41,147 --> 00:41:43,854
focus on what matters,

830
00:41:43,854 --> 00:41:46,068
switch off when you need to,

831
00:41:46,068 --> 00:41:49,053
and, above all,
find balance with your family.

832
00:41:49,053 --> 00:41:51,255
So, let me give a couple of examples.

833
00:41:51,655 --> 00:41:54,363
You're going to hear about this
from Android a bit later,

834
00:41:54,363 --> 00:41:55,795
in their upcoming release.

835
00:41:55,795 --> 00:41:59,177
But one of my favorite features
is Dashboard.

836
00:41:59,177 --> 00:42:03,089
In Android, we're actually
going to give you full visibility

837
00:42:03,089 --> 00:42:05,051
into how you're spending your time--

838
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:07,797
the apps where you're spending your time,

839
00:42:07,797 --> 00:42:10,531
the number of times you unlock your phone
on a given day,

840
00:42:10,531 --> 00:42:13,199
the number of notifications you got,

841
00:42:13,199 --> 00:42:15,910
and we're going to really help you
deal with this better.

842
00:42:17,102 --> 00:42:18,749
Apps can also help.

843
00:42:19,349 --> 00:42:21,080
YouTube is going to take the lead,

844
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,043
and if you choose to do so,

845
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:25,757
it'll actually remind you to take a break.

846
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:28,815
So, for example, if you've been
watching YouTube for a while,

847
00:42:28,815 --> 00:42:32,413
maybe it'll show up and say,
"Hey, it's time to take a break."

848
00:42:33,783 --> 00:42:37,771
YouTube is also going to work to combine--
if users want to--

849
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,533
combine all their notifications

850
00:42:40,533 --> 00:42:43,018
in the form of a daily digest,

851
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:46,924
so that if you have four notifications,
it comes to you once during the day.

852
00:42:46,924 --> 00:42:50,558
YouTube is going to roll out
all these features this week.

853
00:42:51,998 --> 00:42:54,261
(applause)

854
00:42:57,881 --> 00:43:00,265
We've been doing a lot of work in this area.

855
00:43:00,265 --> 00:43:02,512
Family Link is a great example,

856
00:43:02,512 --> 00:43:04,871
where we provide parents tools

857
00:43:04,871 --> 00:43:08,060
to help manage kids' screen time.

858
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,755
I think this is an important part of it.

859
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,763
We want to do more here,

860
00:43:11,763 --> 00:43:15,007
we want to equip kids
to make smart decisions.

861
00:43:15,007 --> 00:43:18,003
So, we have a new approach--
a Google design approach.

862
00:43:18,003 --> 00:43:20,198
It's called Be Internet Awesome,

863
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:23,793
to help kids become safe explorers
of the digital world.

864
00:43:24,663 --> 00:43:28,748
We want kids to be secure, kind,
mindful, when online.

865
00:43:28,748 --> 00:43:32,276
And we are pledging to train
an additional 5 million kids

866
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,677
this coming year.

867
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,524
All these tools you're seeing

868
00:43:35,524 --> 00:43:38,551
are launching with our Digital Wellbeing site

869
00:43:38,551 --> 00:43:40,141
later today.

870
00:43:41,671 --> 00:43:45,462
Another area where we feel
tremendous responsibility

871
00:43:45,462 --> 00:43:46,426
is news.

872
00:43:47,646 --> 00:43:49,667
News is core to our mission.

873
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,174
Also, at times like this,

874
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:54,308
it's more important than ever

875
00:43:54,308 --> 00:43:57,082
to support quality journalism.

876
00:43:57,082 --> 00:43:59,570
It's foundational to how democracies work.

877
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,102
I've always been fond of news.

878
00:44:02,582 --> 00:44:03,733
Growing up in India,

879
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:07,439
I have distinct memory of--
I used to wait for the physical newspaper.

880
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:10,558
My grandfather
used to stay right next to us.

881
00:44:10,998 --> 00:44:12,809
There was a clear hierarchy.

882
00:44:12,809 --> 00:44:15,424
He got his hands on the newspaper first,

883
00:44:15,424 --> 00:44:16,685
then my dad,

884
00:44:16,685 --> 00:44:19,060
and then my brother and I would go at it.

885
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:22,702
I was mainly interested
in the sports section at that time,

886
00:44:22,702 --> 00:44:25,284
but over time
I developed a fondness for news,

887
00:44:25,284 --> 00:44:27,628
and it stayed with me even till today.

888
00:44:28,258 --> 00:44:31,246
It is a challenging time
for the news industry.

889
00:44:31,246 --> 00:44:34,474
Recently, we launched 
Google News Initiative,

890
00:44:34,474 --> 00:44:38,927
and we committed 300 million dollars
over the next three years.

891
00:44:38,927 --> 00:44:42,276
We want to work with organizations
and journalists

892
00:44:42,276 --> 00:44:45,684
to help develop
innovative products and programs

893
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,474
that help the industry.

894
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:52,201
We've also had a product here
for a long time-- Google News.

895
00:44:52,201 --> 00:44:55,196
It was actually built right after 9/11.

896
00:44:55,196 --> 00:44:58,028
It was a 20-person project
by one of our engineers

897
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,322
who wanted to see news
from a variety of sources

898
00:45:01,322 --> 00:45:03,935
to better understand what happened.

899
00:45:04,715 --> 00:45:09,432
Since then, if anything, the volume
and diversity of content has only grown.

900
00:45:10,382 --> 00:45:14,441
I think there is more great journalism
being produced today

901
00:45:14,441 --> 00:45:15,785
than ever before.

902
00:45:16,475 --> 00:45:20,263
It's also true that people
turn to Google in times of need

903
00:45:20,263 --> 00:45:23,931
and we have a responsibility
to provide that information.

904
00:45:24,941 --> 00:45:28,163
This is why we have re-imagined 
our News Project.

905
00:45:28,163 --> 00:45:33,439
We are using AI to bring forward
the best of what journalism has to offer.

906
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:37,987
We want to give users
quality sources that they trust,

907
00:45:37,987 --> 00:45:41,449
but we want to build a product
that works for publishers.

908
00:45:41,449 --> 00:45:46,222
Above all, we want to make sure
we're giving them deeper insight

909
00:45:46,222 --> 00:45:48,165
and a fuller perspective

910
00:45:48,165 --> 00:45:50,255
about any topic they're interested in.

911
00:45:50,705 --> 00:45:53,723
I'm really excited to announce
the new Google News,

912
00:45:53,723 --> 00:45:55,906
and here's Trystan to tell you more.

913
00:45:56,353 --> 00:45:58,962
♪ (music) ♪
(applause)

914
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:06,986
Thank you, Sundar.

915
00:46:06,986 --> 00:46:10,846
With the new Google News,
we set out to help you do three things:

916
00:46:11,376 --> 00:46:14,169
First, keep up with the news you care about.

917
00:46:14,169 --> 00:46:16,710
Second, understand the full story.

918
00:46:16,710 --> 00:46:21,069
And, finally, enjoy and support
the sources you love.

919
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:23,345
After all, without news publishers

920
00:46:23,345 --> 00:46:25,789
and the quality journalism they produce,

921
00:46:25,789 --> 00:46:28,121
we'd have nothing to show you here today.

922
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:31,464
Let's start with how 
we're making it easier for you

923
00:46:31,464 --> 00:46:33,636
to keep up with the news you care about.

924
00:46:34,146 --> 00:46:36,127
As soon as I open Google News,

925
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:37,545
right at the top,

926
00:46:37,545 --> 00:46:42,336
I get a briefing with the top five stories
I need to know right now.

927
00:46:42,336 --> 00:46:44,085
As I move past my briefing,

928
00:46:44,085 --> 00:46:46,899
there are more stories selected just for me.

929
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:51,329
Our AI constantly reads
the firehose of the web for you--

930
00:46:51,329 --> 00:46:55,259
the millions of articles, videos,
podcasts, and comments

931
00:46:55,259 --> 00:46:57,242
being published every minute--

932
00:46:57,242 --> 00:46:59,828
and assembles the key things
you need to know.

933
00:47:00,448 --> 00:47:04,719
Google News also pulls in local voices
and news about events in my area.

934
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:08,235
It's this kind of information that
makes me feel connected to my community.

935
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:11,167
This article from <i>The Chronicle</i>
makes me wonder

936
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:13,890
how long it would take
to ride across this new Bay Bridge.

937
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,513
What's cool is I didn't have to tell the app

938
00:47:17,513 --> 00:47:21,709
that I follow politics, love to bike,
or want information about the Bay area--

939
00:47:21,709 --> 00:47:24,095
it works right out of the box.

940
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:28,427
And, because we've applied techniques like
reinforcement learning throughout the app,

941
00:47:28,427 --> 00:47:30,286
the more I use it, the better it gets.

942
00:47:30,996 --> 00:47:34,347
At any point, I can jump in and say
whether I want to see less or more

943
00:47:34,347 --> 00:47:36,534
of a given publisher or topic.

944
00:47:37,474 --> 00:47:40,083
And whenever I want to see
what the rest of the world is reading,

945
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,517
I can switch over to Headlines

946
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:44,336
to see the top stories
that are generating the most coverage

947
00:47:44,336 --> 00:47:46,311
right now, around the world.

948
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,172
So, let's keep going.

949
00:47:49,402 --> 00:47:52,425
You can see
there are lots of big, gorgeous images

950
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:55,181
that make this app super engaging,

951
00:47:55,181 --> 00:47:57,718
and a truly great video experience.

952
00:47:57,718 --> 00:47:58,933
Let's take a look.

953
00:48:00,313 --> 00:48:03,082
(music and cheering via the device)

954
00:48:06,342 --> 00:48:08,704
This brings you
all the latest videos from YouTube

955
00:48:08,704 --> 00:48:09,959
and around the web.

956
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:15,529
All of our design choices
focus on keeping the app light, easy,

957
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:17,097
fast, and fun.

958
00:48:17,857 --> 00:48:21,504
Our guiding principle is to
let the stories speak for themselves.

959
00:48:21,504 --> 00:48:23,108
So, it's pretty cool, right?

960
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:25,553
(applause)

961
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:32,544
What we're seeing here throughout the app
is the new Google Material Theme.

962
00:48:32,544 --> 00:48:34,868
The entire app is built
using Material design--

963
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:37,298
our adaptable, unified design system

964
00:48:37,298 --> 00:48:40,129
that's been uniquely tailored by Google.

965
00:48:40,129 --> 00:48:42,382
Later today, you'll hear more about this

966
00:48:42,382 --> 00:48:45,436
and how you can use Material themes
in your products.

967
00:48:46,356 --> 00:48:50,239
We're also excited to introduce
a new visual format we call Newscasts.

968
00:48:50,979 --> 00:48:54,159
You're not going to see these
in any other news app.

969
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:57,440
Newscasts are kind of like
a preview of the story,

970
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,675
and they make it easier for you
to get a feel for what's going on.

971
00:49:00,995 --> 00:49:03,203
Check out this one on the <i>Star Wars</i> movie.

972
00:49:04,083 --> 00:49:07,924
Here we're using the latest developments
in natural language understanding

973
00:49:07,924 --> 00:49:09,757
to bring together everything,

974
00:49:09,757 --> 00:49:11,683
from the <i>Solo</i> movie trailer,

975
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:15,444
to news articles, to quotes--
from the cast and more--

976
00:49:15,444 --> 00:49:19,045
in a fresh presentation
that looks absolutely great on your phone.

977
00:49:19,925 --> 00:49:22,521
Newscasts give me an easy way
to get the basics

978
00:49:22,521 --> 00:49:25,105
and decide
where I want to dive in more deeply.

979
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:30,551
And sometimes I even discover things
I never would have found out otherwise.

980
00:49:32,441 --> 00:49:34,400
For the stories I care about most,

981
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,435
or the ones that are really complex,

982
00:49:36,435 --> 00:49:39,521
I want to be able to jump in
and see many different perspectives.

983
00:49:41,751 --> 00:49:44,404
So, let's talk about our second goal
for Google News--

984
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:46,594
understanding the full story.

985
00:49:47,684 --> 00:49:50,130
Today, it takes a lot of work
to broaden your point of view

986
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:52,316
and understand a news story in-depth.

987
00:49:52,716 --> 00:49:56,029
With Google news, we set out
to make that effortless.

988
00:49:56,809 --> 00:49:59,735
Full Coverage is an invitation to learn more.

989
00:50:01,525 --> 00:50:03,549
It gives a complete picture of a story

990
00:50:03,549 --> 00:50:06,645
in terms of how it's being reported
from a variety of sources,

991
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:08,645
and in a variety of formats.

992
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:11,173
We assemble Full Coverage

993
00:50:11,173 --> 00:50:14,678
using a technique
we call temporal co-locality.

994
00:50:15,318 --> 00:50:18,527
This technique enables us
to map relationships between entities

995
00:50:18,527 --> 00:50:21,878
and understand the people,
places, and things in a story

996
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:23,395
right as it evolves.

997
00:50:24,015 --> 00:50:26,967
We applied this to the deluge
of information published to the web

998
00:50:26,967 --> 00:50:28,209
at any given moment

999
00:50:28,209 --> 00:50:30,154
and then organize it around story lines--

1000
00:50:30,154 --> 00:50:31,854
all in real time.

1001
00:50:32,434 --> 00:50:35,306
This is by far
the most powerful feature of the app,

1002
00:50:35,306 --> 00:50:38,572
and provides a whole new way
to dig into the news.

1003
00:50:39,402 --> 00:50:41,223
Take a look at how Full Coverage works

1004
00:50:41,223 --> 00:50:43,483
for the recent power outage
in Puerto Rico.

1005
00:50:44,523 --> 00:50:47,246
There are so many questions
I had about this story, like,

1006
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:48,548
"How did we get here?"

1007
00:50:48,548 --> 00:50:50,036
"Could it have been prevented?"

1008
00:50:50,036 --> 00:50:52,235
and, "Are things actually getting better?"

1009
00:50:52,725 --> 00:50:55,184
We built Full Coverage
to help make sense of it all,

1010
00:50:55,184 --> 00:50:56,583
all in one place.

1011
00:50:58,303 --> 00:51:01,759
We start out with a set of top headlines
that tell me what happened,

1012
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,344
and then start to organize
around the key story aspects

1013
00:51:04,344 --> 00:51:06,626
using our real time event understanding.

1014
00:51:07,326 --> 00:51:11,023
For news events that have played out,
like this one, over weeks and months,

1015
00:51:11,023 --> 00:51:14,196
you can understand
the origin of developments,

1016
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:16,975
by looking at our timeline
of the key moments.

1017
00:51:17,735 --> 00:51:19,410
And while the recovery has begun,

1018
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:21,974
we can clearly see
there's still a long way to go.

1019
00:51:22,984 --> 00:51:26,051
There are also certain questions
we are all asking about a story,

1020
00:51:26,051 --> 00:51:29,095
and we pull those out
so you don't have to hunt for the answers.

1021
00:51:30,665 --> 00:51:33,513
We know context and perspective
come from many places,

1022
00:51:33,513 --> 00:51:38,005
so we show you Tweets
from relevant voices, and opinions,

1023
00:51:38,005 --> 00:51:40,748
analysis, and fact checks,

1024
00:51:40,748 --> 00:51:44,126
to help you understand the story
that one level deeper.

1025
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:49,366
In each case, our AI is highlighting why
this is an important piece of information

1026
00:51:49,366 --> 00:51:51,981
and what unique value it brings.

1027
00:51:53,741 --> 00:51:55,191
Now, when I use Full Coverage,

1028
00:51:55,191 --> 00:51:57,543
I find that I can build
a huge amount of knowledge

1029
00:51:57,543 --> 00:51:59,151
on the topics I care about.

1030
00:51:59,621 --> 00:52:01,991
It's a true 360 degree view

1031
00:52:01,991 --> 00:52:05,650
that goes well beyond what I get
from just scanning a few headlines.

1032
00:52:07,940 --> 00:52:09,061
On top of this,

1033
00:52:09,061 --> 00:52:12,417
our research shows that having
a productive conversation or debate

1034
00:52:12,417 --> 00:52:16,381
requires everyone
to have access to the same information.

1035
00:52:17,111 --> 00:52:19,883
Which is why
everyone sees the same content

1036
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:21,724
in Full Coverage for a topic.

1037
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:26,129
It's an unfiltered view of events
from a range of trusted news sources.

1038
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,116
(applause)

1039
00:52:30,567 --> 00:52:31,709
Thank you.

1040
00:52:33,659 --> 00:52:36,095
So, I've got to say--
I love these new features.

1041
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:38,818
And these are just a few of the things
we think make the new Google News

1042
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:39,958
so exciting.

1043
00:52:40,408 --> 00:52:42,212
But, as we mentioned before,

1044
00:52:42,212 --> 00:52:44,857
none of this would exist
without the great journalism

1045
00:52:44,857 --> 00:52:47,043
news rooms produce every day.

1046
00:52:48,393 --> 00:52:50,043
Which brings us to our final goal--

1047
00:52:50,043 --> 00:52:53,049
helping you enjoy and support
the news sources you love.

1048
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:57,274
We've put publishers front and center
throughout the app,

1049
00:52:57,274 --> 00:52:58,873
and here in the Newsstand section,

1050
00:52:58,873 --> 00:53:02,552
it's easy to find and follow
the sources I already love,

1051
00:53:02,552 --> 00:53:04,512
and browse and discover new ones.

1052
00:53:04,512 --> 00:53:07,291
including over 1,000 magazine titles,

1053
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:10,291
like <i>Wired</i>,<i>
National Geographic</i>, and <i>People</i>,

1054
00:53:10,291 --> 00:53:12,409
which all look great on my phone.

1055
00:53:13,209 --> 00:53:18,276
I can follow publications like <i>USA Today</i>
by directly tapping the star icon.

1056
00:53:18,916 --> 00:53:21,514
And, if there's a publication
I want to subscribe to--

1057
00:53:21,514 --> 00:53:22,871
say, <i>The Washington Post</i>,

1058
00:53:22,871 --> 00:53:25,046
we make it dead simple.

1059
00:53:25,046 --> 00:53:29,191
No more forms, credit card numbers,
or new passwords,

1060
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:31,617
because you're signed in
with your Google account,

1061
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:32,641
you're set.

1062
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:36,218
When you subscribe to a publisher,

1063
00:53:36,218 --> 00:53:40,112
we think you should have easy access
to your content everywhere.

1064
00:53:40,112 --> 00:53:43,501
And this is why we developed
Subscribe with Google.

1065
00:53:44,301 --> 00:53:47,043
Subscribe with Google
enables you to use your Google account

1066
00:53:47,043 --> 00:53:49,867
to access your paid content everywhere,

1067
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:53,913
across all platforms and devices
on Google Search, Google News,

1068
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:55,826
and publishers' own sites.

1069
00:53:57,036 --> 00:54:00,255
We built this in collaboration
with over 60 publishers around the world

1070
00:54:00,255 --> 00:54:02,754
and it will be rolling out
in the coming weeks.

1071
00:54:05,274 --> 00:54:07,577
(applause)

1072
00:54:09,936 --> 00:54:10,976
Thank you.

1073
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:12,972
And this is one
of the many steps we're taking

1074
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:16,393
to make it easier to access
dependable, high quality information,

1075
00:54:16,393 --> 00:54:18,814
when and where it matters most.

1076
00:54:20,484 --> 00:54:22,178
So, that's the new Google News.

1077
00:54:22,178 --> 00:54:24,551
It helps you keep up
with the news you care about,

1078
00:54:24,551 --> 00:54:26,866
with your Briefing and Newscasts,

1079
00:54:26,866 --> 00:54:29,544
understand the full story,
using Full Coverage,

1080
00:54:29,544 --> 00:54:32,208
and enjoy and support
the news sources you love,

1081
00:54:32,208 --> 00:54:34,951
by reading, following, and subscribing.

1082
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,673
And now, for the best news of all,

1083
00:54:38,673 --> 00:54:42,069
we're rolling out
on Android, iOS and the web,

1084
00:54:42,069 --> 00:54:45,211
in 127 countries, starting today.

1085
00:54:45,211 --> 00:54:48,281
(cheering)

1086
00:54:48,281 --> 00:54:50,701
I think so, too.
Pretty cool.

1087
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,837
It will be available
to everyone next week.

1088
00:54:55,887 --> 00:54:59,364
At Google, we know that
getting accurate and timely information

1089
00:54:59,364 --> 00:55:00,833
into people's hands,

1090
00:55:00,833 --> 00:55:03,815
and building and supporting
high quality journalism

1091
00:55:03,815 --> 00:55:07,269
is more important
than it ever has been right now.

1092
00:55:07,269 --> 00:55:10,168
And we are totally committed
to doing our part.

1093
00:55:10,728 --> 00:55:13,458
We can't wait
to continue on this journey with you.

1094
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:15,279
And now, I'm excited to introduce Dave

1095
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:17,712

Hi everyone.
It's great to be here at Google I/O 2018.

1108
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,544
(cheering)

1109
00:57:09,644 --> 00:57:13,244
Ten years ago,
when we launched the first Android phone,

1110
00:57:13,244 --> 00:57:14,769
the T-Mobile G1,

1111
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:17,218
it was with a simple but bold idea--

1112
00:57:17,218 --> 00:57:21,624
to build a mobile platform
that was free and open to everyone.

1113
00:57:21,624 --> 00:57:24,418
And, today, that idea is thriving.

1114
00:57:24,418 --> 00:57:28,110
Our partners have launched
tens of thousands of smartphones,

1115
00:57:28,110 --> 00:57:31,668
used by billions of people
all around the world.

1116
00:57:31,668 --> 00:57:34,849
And through this journey we've seen
Android become more

1117
00:57:34,849 --> 00:57:37,502
than just a smartphone operating system.

1118
00:57:37,502 --> 00:57:43,929
powering new categories of computing,
including wearables, TV, auto, ARVR, IoT.

1119
00:57:44,499 --> 00:57:47,350
And the growth of Android
over the last ten years

1120
00:57:47,350 --> 00:57:49,649
has helped fuel the shift in computing

1121
00:57:49,649 --> 00:57:52,042
from desktop to mobile.

1122
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:56,623
And, as Sundar mentioned, the world
is now on the precipice of another shift.

1123
00:57:56,623 --> 00:57:59,653
AI is going to profoundly change industries

1124
00:57:59,653 --> 00:58:01,482
like healthcare and transport.

1125
00:58:01,482 --> 00:58:04,056
It is already starting to change ours.

1126
00:58:04,056 --> 00:58:08,136
And this brings me to the new version
of Android we're working on--

1127
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:09,177
Android P.

1128
00:58:09,177 --> 00:58:11,677
Android P is an important first step

1129
00:58:11,677 --> 00:58:15,774
towards this vision of AI
at the core of the operating system.

1130
00:58:15,774 --> 00:58:20,073
In fact, AI underpins the first
of three themes in this release,

1131
00:58:20,073 --> 00:58:21,231
which are:

1132
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:22,373
Intelligence,

1133
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,585
Simplicity,

1134
00:58:23,585 --> 00:58:25,418
and Digital wellbeing.

1135
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,319
So, starting with intelligence.

1136
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:30,133
We believe smartphones should be smarter.

1137
00:58:30,133 --> 00:58:32,962
They should learn from you
and they should adapt to you.

1138
00:58:32,962 --> 00:58:35,841
Technologies
such as on-device machine learning

1139
00:58:35,841 --> 00:58:37,926
can learn your usage patterns,

1140
00:58:37,926 --> 00:58:40,367
and automatically anticipate
your next actions,

1141
00:58:40,367 --> 00:58:41,838
saving you time.

1142
00:58:41,838 --> 00:58:43,691
And, because it runs on device,

1143
00:58:43,691 --> 00:58:46,200
the data is kept private to your phone.

1144
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:49,105
So, let's take a look at some examples

1145
00:58:49,105 --> 00:58:51,524
of how we're
applying these technologies to Android

1146
00:58:51,524 --> 00:58:53,818
to build a smarter operating system.

1147
00:58:54,518 --> 00:58:56,915
In pretty much every survey
of smartphone users,

1148
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:59,835
you'll see battery life
as the top concern.

1149
00:58:59,835 --> 00:59:02,671
And, I don't know about you,
but this is my version

1150
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:04,672
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

1151
00:59:04,672 --> 00:59:06,913
(laughter)

1152
00:59:06,913 --> 00:59:08,718
And we've all been there.

1153
00:59:08,718 --> 00:59:11,643
Your battery's been okay, but then
you have one of those outlier days,

1154
00:59:11,643 --> 00:59:15,173
where it's draining faster than normal,
leaving you to run to the charger.

1155
00:59:15,783 --> 00:59:18,117
With Android P
we partnered with Deep Mind

1156
00:59:18,117 --> 00:59:22,366
to work on a new feature
we call Adaptive Battery.

1157
00:59:22,366 --> 00:59:26,011
It's designed to give you
a more consistent battery experience.

1158
00:59:26,351 --> 00:59:28,984
Adaptive battery
uses on-device machine learning

1159
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:32,392
to figure out which apps
you'll use in the next few hours,

1160
00:59:32,392 --> 00:59:35,729
and which you won't use until later,
if at all, today.

1161
00:59:35,729 --> 00:59:37,311
And then, with this understanding,

1162
00:59:37,311 --> 00:59:40,772
the operating system
adapts to your usage patterns.

1163
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:43,157
so that it spends battery
only the apps and services

1164
00:59:43,157 --> 00:59:44,571
that you care about.

1165
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,759
And the results are really promising.

1166
00:59:46,759 --> 00:59:51,346
We're seeing a 30% reduction
in CPU wake-ups for apps in general.

1167
00:59:51,346 --> 00:59:53,912
And this, combined
with other performance improvements,

1168
00:59:53,912 --> 00:59:57,770
including running background processes
on the small CPU cores,

1169
00:59:57,770 --> 01:00:00,668
is resulting in an increase in battery
for many users.

1170
01:00:00,668 --> 01:00:01,991
It's pretty cool.

1171
01:00:02,831 --> 01:00:06,172
Another example
of how the OS is adapting to the user

1172
01:00:06,172 --> 01:00:07,740
is auto-brightness.

1173
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:11,499
Now, most modern smartphones
will automatically adjust the brightness,

1174
01:00:11,499 --> 01:00:13,692
given the current lighting conditions.

1175
01:00:13,692 --> 01:00:15,980
But it's a one-size-fits-all.

1176
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:19,016
They don't take into account
your personal preferences

1177
01:00:19,016 --> 01:00:20,546
and environment.

1178
01:00:20,546 --> 01:00:24,687
So, often what happens, is you then need
to manually adjust the brightness slider,

1179
01:00:24,687 --> 01:00:26,978
resulting in the screen
later becoming too bright

1180
01:00:26,978 --> 01:00:27,999
or too dim.

1181
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:32,516
With Android P, we were introducing
a new on-device machine learning feature

1182
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:35,449
we call Adaptive Brightness.

1183
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:38,860
Adaptive Brightness learns
how you like to set the brightness slider,

1184
01:00:38,860 --> 01:00:40,501
given the ambient lighting,

1185
01:00:40,501 --> 01:00:42,044
and then does it for you

1186
01:00:42,044 --> 01:00:43,685
in a power-efficient way.

1187
01:00:43,685 --> 01:00:46,093
So, you'll literally see
the brightness slider move

1188
01:00:46,093 --> 01:00:48,911
as the phone adapts to your preferences.

1189
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,451
And it's extremely effective.

1190
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:53,289
In fact, we're seeing
almost half of our test users

1191
01:00:53,289 --> 01:00:56,280
now make fewer manual brightness adjustments,

1192
01:00:56,280 --> 01:00:58,594
compared to any previous version of Android.

1193
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:02,350
We're also making the UI more intelligent.

1194
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:06,202
Last year we introduced the concept
of predicted apps,

1195
01:01:06,202 --> 01:01:09,835
a feature that places the next apps
the OS anticipates you need

1196
01:01:09,835 --> 01:01:11,725
on the path you'd normally follow

1197
01:01:11,725 --> 01:01:13,208
to launch that app.

1198
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:14,578
And it's very effective,

1199
01:01:14,578 --> 01:01:17,461
with an almost 60% prediction rate.

1200
01:01:17,461 --> 01:01:18,774
With Android P,

1201
01:01:18,774 --> 01:01:21,975
we're going beyond
simply predicting the next app to launch,

1202
01:01:21,975 --> 01:01:24,896
to predicting the next action
you want to take.

1203
01:01:24,896 --> 01:01:27,785
We call this feature App Actions.

1204
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:29,452
Let's take a look at how it works.

1205
01:01:30,042 --> 01:01:32,586
At the top of the launcher
you can see two actions--

1206
01:01:32,586 --> 01:01:34,389
one, to call my sister, Fiona,

1207
01:01:34,389 --> 01:01:38,158
and another to start a workout on Strava,
for my evening run.

1208
01:01:38,158 --> 01:01:41,593
So, what's happening here
is that the actions are being predicted

1209
01:01:41,593 --> 01:01:43,970
based on my usage patterns.

1210
01:01:43,970 --> 01:01:47,893
The phone is adapting to me
and trying to help me get to my next task

1211
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:48,939
more quickly.

1212
01:01:49,319 --> 01:01:51,904
As another example,
if I connect my headphones,

1213
01:01:51,904 --> 01:01:55,891
Android will surface an action
to resume the album I was listening to.

1214
01:01:56,551 --> 01:01:58,175
To support App Actions,

1215
01:01:58,175 --> 01:02:02,605
developers just need to add
an <i>actions.xml</i> file to their app.

1216
01:02:02,605 --> 01:02:05,352
And then Actions surfaces
not just in the Launcher,

1217
01:02:05,352 --> 01:02:09,245
but in Smart Text selection,
the Play Store, Google Search,

1218
01:02:09,245 --> 01:02:11,000
and the Assistant.

1219
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,447
Take Google Search.

1220
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:15,372
We're experimenting with different ways
to surface actions

1221
01:02:15,372 --> 01:02:17,646
for apps you've installed and use a lot.

1222
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,913
For example, I'm a big Fandango user.

1223
01:02:19,913 --> 01:02:23,688
So, when I search for the new
Avengers movie, <i>Infinity War</i>,

1224
01:02:23,688 --> 01:02:25,940
I get, in addition to regular suggestions,

1225
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,430
I get an action to the Fandango app

1226
01:02:28,430 --> 01:02:29,724
to buy tickets.

1227
01:02:29,724 --> 01:02:30,743
Pretty cool.

1228
01:02:31,953 --> 01:02:34,670
Actions are a simple but powerful idea

1229
01:02:34,670 --> 01:02:36,720
for providing deep links into the app

1230
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,512
given your context.

1231
01:02:38,512 --> 01:02:42,350
But even more powerful
is bringing part of the app UI

1232
01:02:42,350 --> 01:02:44,617
to the user, right there and then.

1233
01:02:44,617 --> 01:02:46,805
We call this feature Slices.

1234
01:02:47,415 --> 01:02:49,271
Slices are a new API

1235
01:02:49,271 --> 01:02:53,263
for developers to define
interactive snippets of their app UI.

1236
01:02:53,263 --> 01:02:55,955
They can be surfaced
in different places in the OS.

1237
01:02:56,825 --> 01:03:01,256
In Android P, we're laying the groundwork
by showing slices first in Search.

1238
01:03:01,256 --> 01:03:02,652
So, let's take a look.

1239
01:03:02,652 --> 01:03:06,487
Let's say I'm out and about
and I need to get a ride to work.

1240
01:03:06,847 --> 01:03:08,991
If I type "lyft"
into the Google Search app,

1241
01:03:08,991 --> 01:03:12,919
I now see a slice from the Lyft app
installed on my phone.

1242
01:03:12,919 --> 01:03:17,152
Lyft is using the Slice API's rich array
of UI templates

1243
01:03:17,152 --> 01:03:20,595
to render a slice of their app
in the context of Search.

1244
01:03:20,595 --> 01:03:23,622
And then Lyft is able to give me
the price for my trip to work,

1245
01:03:23,622 --> 01:03:27,256
and the slice is interactive,
so I can order the ride directly from it.

1246
01:03:27,256 --> 01:03:28,400
Pretty nice.

1247
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:32,381
The Slice templates are versatile
so developers can offer everything

1248
01:03:32,381 --> 01:03:35,134
from playing a video to,
say, checking into a hotel.

1249
01:03:35,694 --> 01:03:38,480
As another example-- if I search for Hawaii,

1250
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:42,068
I'll see a slice from Google Photos
with my vacation pictures.

1251
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,678
And we're working with some amazing partners

1252
01:03:44,678 --> 01:03:46,662
on App Actions and Slices.

1253
01:03:46,662 --> 01:03:49,389
And we'll be opening
an early-access program to developers

1254
01:03:49,389 --> 01:03:50,978
more broadly next month.

1255
01:03:50,978 --> 01:03:54,282
So, we're excited to see
how Actions and, in particular, Slices,

1256
01:03:54,282 --> 01:03:57,547
will enable a dynamic two-way experience

1257
01:03:57,547 --> 01:04:00,932
where the app's UI
can intelligently show up in context.

1258
01:04:01,942 --> 01:04:05,775
So, that's some of the ways
that we're making Android more intelligent

1259
01:04:05,775 --> 01:04:07,512
by teaching the operating system

1260
01:04:07,512 --> 01:04:09,131
to adapt to the user.

1261
01:04:09,531 --> 01:04:11,602
Machine learning's a powerful tool,

1262
01:04:11,602 --> 01:04:13,831
but it can also be intimidating and costly

1263
01:04:13,831 --> 01:04:16,542
for developers to learn and apply.

1264
01:04:16,542 --> 01:04:19,440
And we want to make these tools accessible

1265
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:20,580
and easy to use

1266
01:04:20,580 --> 01:04:22,650
to those who have little or no expertise

1267
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:23,899
in machine learning.

1268
01:04:23,899 --> 01:04:28,007
So, today I'm really excited
to announce ML Kit,

1269
01:04:28,007 --> 01:04:31,370
a new set of APIs
available through Firebase.

1270
01:04:32,250 --> 01:04:33,204
With ML Kit,

1271
01:04:33,204 --> 01:04:35,271
you get on-device APIs,

1272
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:37,856
to text recognition, and face detection,

1273
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:40,032
image labeling, and a lot more.

1274
01:04:40,032 --> 01:04:43,057
And ML Kit also supports the ability

1275
01:04:43,057 --> 01:04:46,276
to tap into Google's
cloud-based ML technologies.

1276
01:04:46,836 --> 01:04:49,078
Architecturally, you can think of ML Kit

1277
01:04:49,078 --> 01:04:51,145
as providing ready-to-use models,

1278
01:04:51,145 --> 01:04:52,680
built on TensorFlow Lite

1279
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,357
and optimized for mobile.

1280
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:57,240
And, best of all,
ML Kit is cross platform,

1281
01:04:57,240 --> 01:05:00,167
so it runs on both Android and iOS.

1282
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:02,687
(cheering)

1283
01:05:07,257 --> 01:05:10,333
We're working with
an early set of partners on ML Kit

1284
01:05:10,333 --> 01:05:12,376
with some really great results.

1285
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:15,807
For example, the popular
calorie counting app, Lose It!

1286
01:05:15,807 --> 01:05:17,505
is using our text recognition model

1287
01:05:17,505 --> 01:05:19,190
to scan nutritional information,

1288
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:21,579
and ML Kits custom-model APIs

1289
01:05:21,579 --> 01:05:24,179
to automatically classify 200 different foods

1290
01:05:24,179 --> 01:05:25,835
through the camera.

1291
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:29,501
You'll hear more about ML Kit
at the developer keynote later today.

1292
01:05:30,421 --> 01:05:33,606
So, we're excited about
making your smartphone more intelligent,

1293
01:05:33,606 --> 01:05:38,074
but it's also important to us
that the technology fades to the back.

1294
01:05:38,594 --> 01:05:41,441
One of our key goals over the last few years

1295
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:45,761
has been to evolve Android's UI
to be simpler and more approachable,

1296
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:47,652
both for the current set of users,

1297
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:50,298
and the next billion Android users.

1298
01:05:50,298 --> 01:05:51,624
With Android P,

1299
01:05:51,624 --> 01:05:54,862
we put a special emphasis on simplicity

1300
01:05:54,862 --> 01:05:58,564
by addressing many pain points
where we thought-- and you told us--

1301
01:05:58,564 --> 01:06:01,913
the experience
was more complicated than it ought to be.

1302
01:06:01,913 --> 01:06:04,744
And you'll find these improvements
on any device

1303
01:06:04,744 --> 01:06:06,437
that adopts Google's version

1304
01:06:06,437 --> 01:06:08,889
of the Android UI, such as Google Pixel

1305
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:11,086
and Android One devices.

1306
01:06:11,856 --> 01:06:15,488
So, let me walk you through
a few live demos on my phone.

1307
01:06:15,878 --> 01:06:17,717
What could possibly go wrong

1308
01:06:17,717 --> 01:06:19,781
in front of 7,000 people in an amphitheater?

1309
01:06:19,781 --> 01:06:21,659
Okay. (laughs)

1310
01:06:21,659 --> 01:06:25,450
As part of Android P,
we're introducing a new system navigation

1311
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:28,186
that we've been working on
for more than a year now.

1312
01:06:28,186 --> 01:06:31,949
And the new design makes
Android's multitasking more approachable

1313
01:06:31,949 --> 01:06:33,773
and easier to understand.

1314
01:06:33,773 --> 01:06:36,049
And the first striking thing you'll notice

1315
01:06:36,049 --> 01:06:38,401
is the single, clean Home button.

1316
01:06:38,401 --> 01:06:42,045
And the design recognizes a trend
towards smaller screen bezels

1317
01:06:42,045 --> 01:06:44,282
and places an emphasis on gestures

1318
01:06:44,282 --> 01:06:46,700
over multiple buttons
at the edge of the screen.

1319
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:47,963
So, when I swipe up,

1320
01:06:47,963 --> 01:06:49,888
I'm immediately brought to the Overview,

1321
01:06:49,888 --> 01:06:52,404
where I can resume apps I've recently used.

1322
01:06:52,404 --> 01:06:55,285
I also get five predicted apps
at the bottom of the screen

1323
01:06:55,285 --> 01:06:57,030
to save me time.

1324
01:06:57,030 --> 01:07:00,623
Now, if I continue to swipe up,
or I swipe up a second time,

1325
01:07:00,623 --> 01:07:02,493
I get to All Apps.

1326
01:07:02,493 --> 01:07:04,253
So, architecturally, what we've done

1327
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:08,504
is combine the All Apps
and Overview spaces into one.

1328
01:07:09,074 --> 01:07:11,312
The swipe up gesture works from anywhere,

1329
01:07:11,312 --> 01:07:13,303
no matter what app I'm in

1330
01:07:13,303 --> 01:07:16,109
so that I can quickly get back
to All Apps and Overview

1331
01:07:16,109 --> 01:07:18,394
without losing the context I'm in.

1332
01:07:18,884 --> 01:07:20,774
And, if you prefer,

1333
01:07:20,774 --> 01:07:22,964
you can also use the Quick Scrub gesture

1334
01:07:22,964 --> 01:07:24,811
by sliding the Home button sideways

1335
01:07:24,811 --> 01:07:27,870
to scroll through
your recent set of apps like so.

1336
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:29,967
(applause)

1337
01:07:33,354 --> 01:07:36,390
Now, one of the nice things
about the larger horizontal Overview

1338
01:07:36,390 --> 01:07:38,440
is that the app content is now glanceable,

1339
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:41,585
so you can easily refer back
to information in a previous app.

1340
01:07:42,045 --> 01:07:46,308
Even more is we've extended
Smart Text Selection to work in Overview.

1341
01:07:46,308 --> 01:07:49,980
So, for example, if I tap anywhere
on the phrase, The Killers,

1342
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:51,978
all of the phrase will be selected for me,

1343
01:07:51,978 --> 01:07:55,447
and then I get an action
to listen to it on Spotify, like so.

1344
01:07:55,777 --> 01:07:59,017
And we've extended Smart Text Selection's
neural network

1345
01:07:59,017 --> 01:08:00,669
to recognize more entities,

1346
01:08:00,669 --> 01:08:04,956
like sports teams and music artists,
and flight codes and more.

1347
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:07,708
I've been using this View
navigation system for the last month,

1348
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,199
and I absolutely love it.

1349
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:11,058
It's a much faster, more powerful way

1350
01:08:11,058 --> 01:08:12,610
to multitask on the go.

1351
01:08:13,257 --> 01:08:16,667
So, changing how Navigation works--
it's a pretty big deal.

1352
01:08:16,667 --> 01:08:20,145
But sometimes small changes
can make a big difference, too.

1353
01:08:20,145 --> 01:08:21,704
So, take volume control.

1354
01:08:21,944 --> 01:08:24,647
We've all been there--
you try to turn down the volume

1355
01:08:24,647 --> 01:08:26,033
before a video starts,

1356
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:28,276
but instead, you turn down the ringer volume

1357
01:08:28,277 --> 01:08:31,139
and then the video
blasts everyone around you.

1358
01:08:31,139 --> 01:08:32,475
So, how are we fixing it?

1359
01:08:32,475 --> 01:08:35,563
Well, you can see 
the new simplified volume controls here.

1360
01:08:35,933 --> 01:08:38,917
They're vertical,
and located beside the hardware buttons--

1361
01:08:38,917 --> 01:08:40,142
so they're intuitive.

1362
01:08:40,142 --> 01:08:44,447
But the key difference is that the slider
now adjusts the media volume by default,

1363
01:08:44,447 --> 01:08:47,127
because that's the thing
you want to change most often.

1364
01:08:47,127 --> 01:08:50,785
And, for the ringer volume,
all you really care about is On, Silent,

1365
01:08:50,786 --> 01:08:52,529
and Off, like so.

1366
01:08:52,859 --> 01:08:53,802
Okay.

1367
01:08:54,082 --> 01:08:56,426
We've also greatly simplified rotation.

1368
01:08:56,426 --> 01:08:57,663
And, if you're like me,

1369
01:08:57,663 --> 01:08:59,786
and hate your device 
rotating at the wrong time

1370
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:01,042
you'll love this feature.

1371
01:09:01,042 --> 01:09:03,606
So, right now, I'm in the Lock Rotation mode.

1372
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,202
And let me launch an app,

1373
01:09:05,202 --> 01:09:07,612
and you'll notice
that when I rotate the device,

1374
01:09:07,612 --> 01:09:10,236
a new Rotation button appears on the Nav bar.

1375
01:09:10,236 --> 01:09:13,442
And then I can just tap on it
and rotate under my own control.

1376
01:09:13,442 --> 01:09:14,435
It's pretty cool.

1377
01:09:14,435 --> 01:09:16,604
(applause)

1378
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:21,700
Alright, so that's a quick tour

1379
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:25,407
of some of the ways that we've simplified
user experience in Android P.

1380
01:09:25,407 --> 01:09:26,805
And there's lots more.

1381
01:09:26,805 --> 01:09:29,256
Everything from a redesigned work profile,

1382
01:09:29,256 --> 01:09:31,153
to better screenshots,

1383
01:09:31,153 --> 01:09:34,379
to improved
notifications management, and more.

1384
01:09:34,379 --> 01:09:36,506
Speaking of notifications management,

1385
01:09:36,506 --> 01:09:40,265
we want to give you more control
over demands on your attention.

1386
01:09:40,265 --> 01:09:43,475
And this highlights a concept
that Sundar alluded to earlier--

1387
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:45,929
making it easier
to move between your digital life

1388
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:47,510
and your real life.

1389
01:09:47,510 --> 01:09:49,840
To learn more about this important area,

1390
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:52,090
and our third theme,
let me hand over to Sameer.

1391
01:09:52,090 --> 01:09:53,099
Thanks.

1392
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:54,775
(applause)

1393
01:09:54,775 --> 01:09:57,199
♪ (music) ♪

1394
01:10:01,435 --> 01:10:02,535
Hi everyone!

1395
01:10:04,475 --> 01:10:06,106
On a recent family vacation,

1396
01:10:06,106 --> 01:10:08,306
my partner asked if she could see my phone

1397
01:10:08,306 --> 01:10:10,501
right after we got to our hotel room.

1398
01:10:10,501 --> 01:10:11,809
She took it from me,

1399
01:10:11,809 --> 01:10:14,236
walked over to the hotel safe,

1400
01:10:14,236 --> 01:10:16,612
locked it inside,

1401
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,006
and turned and looked me
right in the eye and said,

1402
01:10:19,006 --> 01:10:22,661
"You get this back
in seven days when we leave."

1403
01:10:22,661 --> 01:10:24,485
(laughter)

1404
01:10:24,485 --> 01:10:27,192
Whoa! I was shocked.

1405
01:10:27,192 --> 01:10:29,047
I was kind of angry.

1406
01:10:29,047 --> 01:10:33,835
But after a few hours,
something pretty cool happened.

1407
01:10:33,835 --> 01:10:36,060
Without all the distractions
from my phone,

1408
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:38,171
I was actually able to disconnect,

1409
01:10:38,171 --> 01:10:39,992
be fully present,

1410
01:10:39,992 --> 01:10:44,268
and I ended up
having a wonderful family vacation.

1411
01:10:44,268 --> 01:10:45,609
But it's not just me.

1412
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:48,488
Our team has heard
so many stories from people

1413
01:10:48,488 --> 01:10:51,562
who are trying to find
the right balance with technology.

1414
01:10:52,182 --> 01:10:53,962
As you heard from Sundar,

1415
01:10:53,962 --> 01:10:55,981
helping people with their digital wellbeing

1416
01:10:55,981 --> 01:10:58,296
is more important to us than ever.

1417
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:02,833
People tell us a lot of the time
they spend on their phone is really useful.

1418
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:06,274
But some of it
they wish they'd spent on other things.

1419
01:11:06,274 --> 01:11:09,322
In fact, we found over 70% of people

1420
01:11:09,322 --> 01:11:12,153
want more help striking this balance.

1421
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:13,838
So, we've been working hard

1422
01:11:13,838 --> 01:11:16,540
to add key capabilities right into Android

1423
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:19,396
to help people
find the balance with technology

1424
01:11:19,396 --> 01:11:20,825
that they're looking for.

1425
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:23,767
One of the first things we focused on

1426
01:11:23,767 --> 01:11:26,105
was helping you understand your habits.

1427
01:11:26,465 --> 01:11:28,491
Android P will show you a Dashboard

1428
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:31,067
of how you're spending time on your device.

1429
01:11:31,067 --> 01:11:32,111
As you saw earlier,

1430
01:11:32,111 --> 01:11:34,948
you can see how much time you spent in apps,

1431
01:11:34,948 --> 01:11:37,317
how many times
you've unlocked your device today,

1432
01:11:37,317 --> 01:11:39,964
and how many notifications you've received.

1433
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:42,707
And you can drill down
on any of these things.

1434
01:11:42,707 --> 01:11:45,702
For example,
here's my Gmail data from Saturday.

1435
01:11:45,702 --> 01:11:49,201
And when I saw this it did make me wonder
whether I should've been on my email

1436
01:11:49,201 --> 01:11:50,257
all weekend.

1437
01:11:50,257 --> 01:11:52,541
But that's kind of the point
of the Dashboard.

1438
01:11:52,971 --> 01:11:57,307
Now, when you're engaging
is one part of understanding.

1439
01:11:57,307 --> 01:11:59,430
But what you're engaging with in apps

1440
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:00,948
is equally important.

1441
01:12:01,468 --> 01:12:03,094
It's like watching TV--

1442
01:12:03,094 --> 01:12:05,870
catching up on your favorite shows
at the end of a long day

1443
01:12:05,870 --> 01:12:07,402
can feel pretty good.

1444
01:12:07,402 --> 01:12:10,052
But watching an infomercial
might leave you wondering

1445
01:12:10,052 --> 01:12:12,582
why you didn't do something else instead.

1446
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:16,067
Many developers call this concept
"meaningful engagement."

1447
01:12:16,067 --> 01:12:19,175
And we've been working closely
with many of our developer partners

1448
01:12:19,175 --> 01:12:20,411
who share the goal

1449
01:12:20,411 --> 01:12:23,384
of helping people use technology
in healthy ways.

1450
01:12:24,044 --> 01:12:25,486
So, in Android P,

1451
01:12:25,486 --> 01:12:27,984
developers can link
to more detailed breakdowns

1452
01:12:27,984 --> 01:12:30,188
of how you're spending time in their app

1453
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:31,441
from this new Dashboard.

1454
01:12:31,941 --> 01:12:34,756
For example,
YouTube will be adding a deep link

1455
01:12:34,756 --> 01:12:36,714
where you can see total watch time

1456
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:39,062
across mobile and desktop

1457
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:41,077
and access many of the helpful tools

1458
01:12:41,077 --> 01:12:43,575
that Sundar shared earlier.

1459
01:12:44,435 --> 01:12:46,518
Now, understanding is a good start.

1460
01:12:46,868 --> 01:12:50,044
But Android P also gives you controls

1461
01:12:50,044 --> 01:12:54,175
to help you manage
how and when you spend time on your phone.

1462
01:12:54,175 --> 01:12:56,080
Maybe you have an app that you love,

1463
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:58,540
but you're spending more time in it
than you realize.

1464
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:02,376
Android P lets you set
time limits on your apps

1465
01:13:02,376 --> 01:13:04,917
and will nudge you
when you're close to your limit

1466
01:13:04,917 --> 01:13:06,849
that it's time to do something else.

1467
01:13:06,849 --> 01:13:08,457
And, for the rest of the day,

1468
01:13:08,457 --> 01:13:10,282
that app icon is grayed out,

1469
01:13:10,282 --> 01:13:11,788
to remind you of your goal.

1470
01:13:12,998 --> 01:13:16,367
People have also told us
they struggle to be fully present

1471
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:19,609
for the dinner that they're at
or the meeting that they're attending,

1472
01:13:19,609 --> 01:13:22,014
because the notifications
they get on their device

1473
01:13:22,014 --> 01:13:23,242
can be distracting

1474
01:13:23,242 --> 01:13:25,558
and too tempting to resist.

1475
01:13:25,558 --> 01:13:27,939
Come on-- we've all been there.

1476
01:13:28,749 --> 01:13:30,574
So we're making improvements

1477
01:13:30,574 --> 01:13:32,043
to Do Not Disturb mode,

1478
01:13:32,043 --> 01:13:34,999
to silence not just 
the phone calls and texts,

1479
01:13:34,999 --> 01:13:38,564
but also the visual interruptions
that pop up on your screen.

1480
01:13:38,994 --> 01:13:41,569
To make Do Not Disturb even easier to use,

1481
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:43,472
we've created a new gesture

1482
01:13:43,472 --> 01:13:46,467
that we've affectionately
code-named Shush.

1483
01:13:46,467 --> 01:13:48,176
(laughter)

1484
01:13:48,176 --> 01:13:52,462
If you turn your phone over on the table,
it automatically enters Do Not Disturb

1485
01:13:52,464 --> 01:13:55,121
so you can focus on being present--

1486
01:13:55,121 --> 01:13:58,507
no pings, vibrations, or other distractions.

1487
01:13:58,507 --> 01:14:00,726
(applause)

1488
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:05,956
Of course, in an emergency,

1489
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:08,946
we all want to make sure we're still
reachable by the key people in our lives,

1490
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:11,032
like your partner or your child's school.

1491
01:14:11,032 --> 01:14:13,427
Android P will help you
set up a list of contacts

1492
01:14:13,427 --> 01:14:15,907
that can always
get through to you with a phone call,

1493
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:18,019
even if Do Not Disturb is turned on.

1494
01:14:19,019 --> 01:14:22,462
Finally, we heard from people
that they often check their phone

1495
01:14:22,462 --> 01:14:24,073
right before going to bed,

1496
01:14:24,073 --> 01:14:25,903
and, before you know it,

1497
01:14:25,903 --> 01:14:27,723
an hour or two has slipped by.

1498
01:14:27,723 --> 01:14:31,330
And, honestly, this happens to me
at least once a week.

1499
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,095
Getting a good night's sleep is critical,

1500
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:36,180
and technology should help you with this,

1501
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:38,203
not prevent it from happening.

1502
01:14:38,743 --> 01:14:41,421
So, we created Wind Down mode.

1503
01:14:41,871 --> 01:14:44,963
You can tell the Google Assistant
what time you aim to go to bed,

1504
01:14:44,963 --> 01:14:47,848
and when that time arrives
it will switch on Do Not Disturb,

1505
01:14:47,848 --> 01:14:50,192
and fade the screen to gray scale,

1506
01:14:50,192 --> 01:14:52,577
which is far less stimulating for the brain,

1507
01:14:52,577 --> 01:14:55,033
and can help you set the phone down.

1508
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:57,130
It's such a simple idea,

1509
01:14:57,130 --> 01:15:00,045
but I found it's amazing
how quickly I put my phone away

1510
01:15:00,045 --> 01:15:03,305
when all my apps
go back to the days before color TV.

1511
01:15:03,305 --> 01:15:05,528
(laughter)

1512
01:15:05,528 --> 01:15:07,110
(applause)

1513
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,007
Don't worry, all the colors
return in the morning when you wake up.

1514
01:15:14,137 --> 01:15:17,972
Okay, that was a quick tour
of some of the digital wellbeing features

1515
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:20,477
we're bringing to Android P this fall,

1516
01:15:20,477 --> 01:15:22,771
starting with Google Pixel.

1517
01:15:22,771 --> 01:15:25,780
Digital wellbeing is going to be
a long term theme for us,

1518
01:15:25,780 --> 01:15:28,450
so look for much more to come in the future.

1519
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,746
Beyond the three themes
of intelligence, simplicity,

1520
01:15:31,746 --> 01:15:34,286
and digital wellbeing
that Dave and I talked about,

1521
01:15:34,286 --> 01:15:37,386
there are literally hundreds
of other improvements coming

1522
01:15:37,386 --> 01:15:38,586
in Android P.

1523
01:15:38,586 --> 01:15:42,506
I'm especially excited about the security
advancements we've added to the platform,

1524
01:15:42,506 --> 01:15:45,647
and you can learn more about them
at the Android Security session

1525
01:15:45,647 --> 01:15:46,747
on Thursday.

1526
01:15:47,317 --> 01:15:49,442
But your big question is:

1527
01:15:49,442 --> 01:15:51,024
That's all great.

1528
01:15:51,024 --> 01:15:53,058
How do I try some of this stuff?

1529
01:15:53,968 --> 01:15:58,537
Well, today we're announcing 
Android P Beta.

1530
01:15:58,537 --> 01:16:00,414
(applause)

1531
01:16:03,859 --> 01:16:07,418
And with efforts in Android Oreo
to make OS upgrades easier,

1532
01:16:07,418 --> 01:16:10,419
Android P Beta
is available on Google Pixel

1533
01:16:10,419 --> 01:16:15,149
and seven more
manufacturer flagship devices today.

1534
01:16:15,149 --> 01:16:17,100
(applause)

1535
01:16:19,357 --> 01:16:20,806
You can head over to this link

1536
01:16:20,806 --> 01:16:23,283
to find out how
to receive the Beta on your device,

1537
01:16:23,283 --> 01:16:25,561
and please do let us know what you think.

1538
01:16:25,561 --> 01:16:28,215
Okay, that's a wrap
on what's new at Android,

1539
01:16:28,215 --> 01:16:30,826
and now I'd like to introduce Jen
to talk about Maps.

1540
01:16:30,826 --> 01:16:31,885
Thank you.

Building technology

1556
01:17:39,802 --> 01:17:42,990
to help people
in the real world, every day,

1557
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:44,759
has been core to who we are

1558
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:46,530
and what we've focused on at Google

1559
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:47,924
from the very start.

1560
01:17:49,034 --> 01:17:51,393
Recent advancements in AI
and computer vision

1561
01:17:51,393 --> 01:17:54,313
have allowed us to dramatically
improve long-standing products

1562
01:17:54,313 --> 01:17:55,681
like Google Maps,

1563
01:17:55,681 --> 01:17:59,110
and have also made possible
brand new products, like Google Lens.

1564
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,863
Let's start with Google Maps.

1565
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,962
Maps was built to assist everyone,

1566
01:18:04,962 --> 01:18:07,018
wherever they are in the world.

1567
01:18:07,018 --> 01:18:10,181
We've mapped
over 220 countries and territories,

1568
01:18:10,181 --> 01:18:13,930
and put hundreds of millions
of businesses and places on the map.

1569
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:17,288
And, in doing so,
we've given more than a billion people

1570
01:18:17,288 --> 01:18:18,801
the ability to travel the world

1571
01:18:18,801 --> 01:18:21,569
with the confidence
that they won't get lost along the way.

1572
01:18:22,289 --> 01:18:24,059
But we're far from done.

1573
01:18:24,059 --> 01:18:26,353
We've been making Maps
smarter and more detailed

1574
01:18:26,353 --> 01:18:28,851
as advancements in AI have accelerated.

1575
01:18:29,451 --> 01:18:33,663
We're now able to automatically add
new addresses, businesses, and buildings

1576
01:18:33,663 --> 01:18:37,288
that we extract from Street View
and satellite imagery directly to the Map.

1577
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:39,941
This is critical in rural areas,

1578
01:18:39,941 --> 01:18:41,960
in places without formal addresses,

1579
01:18:41,960 --> 01:18:44,586
and in fast-changing cities,
like Lagos here,

1580
01:18:44,586 --> 01:18:47,770
where we've literally changed
the face of the map in the last few years.

1581
01:18:48,490 --> 01:18:50,151
(cheering)

1582
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:53,606
Hello, Nigeria! (laughs)

1583
01:18:53,606 --> 01:18:55,581
(laughter)

1584
01:18:56,168 --> 01:18:59,162
We can also tell you if the business
you're looking for is open,

1585
01:18:59,162 --> 01:19:00,189
how busy it is,

1586
01:19:00,189 --> 01:19:01,784
what the wait time is,

1587
01:19:01,784 --> 01:19:03,959
and even how long
people usually spend there.

1588
01:19:05,179 --> 01:19:07,400
We can tell you before you leave

1589
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,702
whether parking
is going to be easy or difficult,

1590
01:19:09,702 --> 01:19:11,295
and we can help you find it.

1591
01:19:11,875 --> 01:19:15,599
And we can now give you different routes
based on your mode of transportation,

1592
01:19:15,599 --> 01:19:18,013
whether you're riding a motorbike
or driving a car.

1593
01:19:18,663 --> 01:19:22,380
And, by understanding how different types
of vehicles move at different speeds,

1594
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,524
we can make more accurate
traffic predictions for everyone.

1595
01:19:26,574 --> 01:19:29,777
But we've only scratched the surface
of what Maps can do.

1596
01:19:30,477 --> 01:19:34,525
We originally designed Maps
to help you understand where you are,

1597
01:19:34,525 --> 01:19:37,077
and to help you get from here to there.

1598
01:19:37,077 --> 01:19:38,651
But, over the past few years,

1599
01:19:38,651 --> 01:19:42,238
we've seen our users
demand more and more of Maps.

1600
01:19:42,678 --> 01:19:45,230
They're bringing us harder
and more complex questions

1601
01:19:45,230 --> 01:19:48,561
about the world around them,
and they're trying to get more done.

1602
01:19:49,361 --> 01:19:52,680
Today, our users aren't just asking
for the fastest route to a place.

1603
01:19:53,270 --> 01:19:55,731
They also want to know
what's happening around them,

1604
01:19:55,731 --> 01:19:57,580
what the new places to try are,

1605
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:59,587
and what locals love
in their neighborhood.

1606
01:20:01,567 --> 01:20:04,709
The world is filled
with amazing experiences,

1607
01:20:04,709 --> 01:20:07,309
like cheering for your favorite team
at a sports bar,

1608
01:20:07,309 --> 01:20:10,826
or a night out with friends or family
at a cosy neighborhood bistro.

1609
01:20:11,506 --> 01:20:14,286
We want to make it easy for you
to explore and experience

1610
01:20:14,286 --> 01:20:16,412
more of what the world has to offer.

1611
01:20:16,962 --> 01:20:19,819
We've been working hard
on an updated version of Google Maps

1612
01:20:19,819 --> 01:20:22,326
that keeps you in the know
on what's new and trending

1613
01:20:22,326 --> 01:20:23,824
in the areas you care about.

1614
01:20:23,824 --> 01:20:26,059
It helps you find the best place for you,

1615
01:20:26,059 --> 01:20:28,497
based on your context and interests.

1616
01:20:28,497 --> 01:20:31,494
Let me give you a few examples
of what this is going to look like,

1617
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:32,926
with some help from Sophia.

1618
01:20:34,086 --> 01:20:38,067
First, we're adding a new tab 
to Maps called For You.

1619
01:20:38,387 --> 01:20:40,582
It's designed to tell you
what you need to know

1620
01:20:40,582 --> 01:20:42,588
about the neighborhoods you care about--

1621
01:20:42,588 --> 01:20:44,244
new places that are opening,

1622
01:20:44,244 --> 01:20:45,373
what's trending now,

1623
01:20:45,373 --> 01:20:47,572
and personal recommendations.

1624
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:50,919
Here, I'm being told about a cafe
that just opened in my area.

1625
01:20:51,649 --> 01:20:53,288
If we scroll down,

1626
01:20:53,288 --> 01:20:56,158
I see a list of the restaurants
that are trending this week.

1627
01:20:56,578 --> 01:20:58,969
This is super useful, because,
with zero work,

1628
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:01,623
Maps is giving me ideas
to kick me out of my rut

1629
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:04,051
and inspire me to try something new.

1630
01:21:05,311 --> 01:21:08,607
But how do I know
if a place is really right for me?

1631
01:21:09,067 --> 01:21:12,442
Have you ever had the experience
of looking at lots of places,

1632
01:21:12,442 --> 01:21:14,046
all with four-star ratings,

1633
01:21:14,046 --> 01:21:16,623
and you're pretty sure there's some
you're going to like a lot

1634
01:21:16,623 --> 01:21:18,549
and others that maybe aren't quite so great,

1635
01:21:18,549 --> 01:21:20,789
but you're not sure how to tell which ones?

1636
01:21:21,319 --> 01:21:24,171
We've created a score called Your Match

1637
01:21:24,171 --> 01:21:27,204
to help you find more places
that you'll love.

1638
01:21:27,664 --> 01:21:29,882
Your Match uses machine learning

1639
01:21:29,882 --> 01:21:33,356
to combine what Google knows
about hundreds of millions of places

1640
01:21:33,356 --> 01:21:35,726
with the information that I've added--

1641
01:21:35,726 --> 01:21:37,016
restaurants I've rated,

1642
01:21:37,016 --> 01:21:38,295
cuisines I've liked,

1643
01:21:38,295 --> 01:21:40,115
and places that I've been to.

1644
01:21:41,115 --> 01:21:42,836
If you click into the Match number,

1645
01:21:42,836 --> 01:21:45,893
you'll see reasons explaining
why it's recommended just for you.

1646
01:21:46,153 --> 01:21:48,599
It's your personal score for places.

1647
01:21:48,609 --> 01:21:51,664
And our early testers
are telling us that they love it.

1648
01:21:52,214 --> 01:21:55,295
Now, you can confidently pick the places
that are best for you,

1649
01:21:55,295 --> 01:21:57,051
whether you're planning ahead

1650
01:21:57,051 --> 01:22:00,711
or on the go and need to make
a quick decision, right now.

1651
01:22:00,711 --> 01:22:02,314
Thanks so much, Sophia.

1652
01:22:02,314 --> 01:22:04,800
(applause)

1653
01:22:06,474 --> 01:22:09,228
The For You tab, and the Your Match score,

1654
01:22:09,228 --> 01:22:11,951
are great examples
of how we can help you stay in the know

1655
01:22:11,951 --> 01:22:13,877
and choose places with confidence.

1656
01:22:14,307 --> 01:22:16,822
Now, another pain point
we often hear from our users

1657
01:22:16,822 --> 01:22:19,572
is that planning with others
can be a real challenge.

1658
01:22:19,572 --> 01:22:22,453
So, we wanted to make it easier
to pick a place together.

1659
01:22:22,453 --> 01:22:23,847
Here's how.

1660
01:22:23,847 --> 01:22:25,812
Long press on any place

1661
01:22:25,812 --> 01:22:27,694
to add it to a short list.

1662
01:22:27,694 --> 01:22:29,413
Now, I'm always up for ramen,

1663
01:22:29,413 --> 01:22:31,512
but I know my friends
have lots of opinions of their own,

1664
01:22:31,512 --> 01:22:34,434
so I can add some more options
to give them some choices.

1665
01:22:34,434 --> 01:22:36,942
When you've collected enough places
that you like

1666
01:22:36,942 --> 01:22:39,880
share the list with your friends
to get their input, too.

1667
01:22:40,090 --> 01:22:42,417
You can easily share,
with just a couple of taps,

1668
01:22:42,417 --> 01:22:44,636
on any platform that you prefer.

1669
01:22:44,636 --> 01:22:47,240
Then, my friends can add more places
that they want to,

1670
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:51,805
or just vote with one simple click
so we can quickly choose a group favorite.

1671
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:54,581
So now, instead of copying and pasting
a bunch of links

1672
01:22:54,581 --> 01:22:56,312
and sending texts back and forth,

1673
01:22:56,312 --> 01:22:59,151
decisions can be quick, easy, and fun.

1674
01:22:59,861 --> 01:23:02,525
This is just a glimpse
of some of what's coming to Maps

1675
01:23:02,525 --> 01:23:05,266
on both Android and iOS later this summer.

1676
01:23:05,566 --> 01:23:08,389
And we see this is just the beginning
of what Maps can do

1677
01:23:08,389 --> 01:23:10,456
to help you make better decisions on the go

1678
01:23:10,456 --> 01:23:12,993
and to experience the world in new ways,

1679
01:23:12,993 --> 01:23:16,273
from your local neighborhood,
to the far-flung corners of the world.

1680
01:23:19,373 --> 01:23:22,049
This discovery experience
wouldn't be possible

1681
01:23:22,049 --> 01:23:24,425
without small businesses.

1682
01:23:24,425 --> 01:23:26,809
Because, when we help people
discover new places,

1683
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:30,713
we're also helping local businesses
be discovered by new customers.

1684
01:23:31,783 --> 01:23:34,322
These are businesses
like the bakery in your neighborhood,

1685
01:23:34,322 --> 01:23:36,245
or the barbershop around the corner.

1686
01:23:36,635 --> 01:23:39,440
These businesses
are the fabric of our communities

1687
01:23:39,440 --> 01:23:42,881
and we're deeply committed
to helping them succeed with Google.

1688
01:23:44,271 --> 01:23:46,892
Every month, we connect users 
to businesses nearby

1689
01:23:46,892 --> 01:23:49,456
more than 9 billion times,

1690
01:23:49,456 --> 01:23:51,550
including over a billion phone calls

1691
01:23:51,550 --> 01:23:54,191
and 3 billion direction requests
to their stores.

1692
01:23:55,381 --> 01:23:57,667
In the last few months,
we've been adding even more tools

1693
01:23:57,667 --> 01:24:00,411
for local businesses to communicate
and engage with their customers

1694
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:01,733
in meaningful ways.

1695
01:24:02,143 --> 01:24:05,017
You can now see daily posts
on events or offers

1696
01:24:05,017 --> 01:24:07,055
from many of your favorite businesses.

1697
01:24:07,055 --> 01:24:09,020
And soon you will be able
to get updates from them

1698
01:24:09,020 --> 01:24:10,862
in the new For You stream, too.

1699
01:24:11,042 --> 01:24:12,520
And, when you're ready,

1700
01:24:12,520 --> 01:24:16,127
you can easily book an appointment
or place an order with just one click.

1701
01:24:18,617 --> 01:24:21,650
We're always inspired to see
how technology brings opportunities

1702
01:24:21,650 --> 01:24:22,823
to everyone.

1703
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,742
The reason we've invested
over the last 13 years

1704
01:24:25,742 --> 01:24:30,007
in mapping every road,
every building, and every business,

1705
01:24:30,007 --> 01:24:31,090
is because it matters.

1706
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:34,821
When we map the world,
communities come alive

1707
01:24:34,821 --> 01:24:38,506
and opportunities arise in places
we never would have thought possible.

1708
01:24:40,146 --> 01:24:41,617
And, as computing evolves,

1709
01:24:41,617 --> 01:24:44,544
we're going to keep challenging ourselves
to think of new ways

1710
01:24:44,544 --> 01:24:47,126
that we can help you get things done
in the real world.

1711
01:24:47,126 --> 01:24:49,865
I'd like to invite Aparna to the stage
to share how we're doing this,

1712
01:24:49,865 --> 01:24:52,270
both in Google Maps, and beyond.

1713
01:24:52,270 --> 01:24:54,808
♪ (music) ♪

1714
01:25:03,323 --> 01:25:06,009
The cameras in our smartphones--

1715
01:25:06,009 --> 01:25:09,714
they connect us to the world around us
in a very immediate way.

1716
01:25:09,714 --> 01:25:12,838
They help us save a moment,
capture memories, and communicate.

1717
01:25:13,358 --> 01:25:15,619
But with advances
in AI and computer vision

1718
01:25:15,619 --> 01:25:17,549
that you heard Sundar talk about,

1719
01:25:17,549 --> 01:25:20,326
we said, "What if the cameras can do more?

1720
01:25:20,326 --> 01:25:23,247
What if the cameras
can help us answer questions?"

1721
01:25:23,247 --> 01:25:27,614
Questions like, "Where am I going?"
or, "What's that in front of me?"

1722
01:25:28,664 --> 01:25:30,337
Let me paint a familiar picture.

1723
01:25:30,337 --> 01:25:31,726
You exit the subway.

1724
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:34,006
You're already running late
for an appointment--

1725
01:25:34,006 --> 01:25:36,812
or a tech company conference--
that happens.

1726
01:25:36,812 --> 01:25:40,577
And then your phone says,
"Head south on Market Street."

1727
01:25:41,067 --> 01:25:42,239
So, what do you do?

1728
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:45,332
One problem-- you have no idea
which way is south.

1729
01:25:45,332 --> 01:25:46,805
So, you look down at the phone,

1730
01:25:46,805 --> 01:25:48,670
you're looking
at that blue dot on the map,

1731
01:25:48,670 --> 01:25:52,043
and you're starting to walk to see
if it's moving in the same direction.

1732
01:25:52,043 --> 01:25:54,175
If it's not, you're turning around.

1733
01:25:54,175 --> 01:25:56,125
- (laughter)
- We've all been there.

1734
01:25:57,455 --> 01:26:00,780
So, we asked ourselves, "Well,
what if the camera can help us here?"

1735
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:03,382
Our teams have been working really hard

1736
01:26:03,382 --> 01:26:06,357
to combine the power of the camera,
the computer vision,

1737
01:26:06,357 --> 01:26:08,200
with Street View and Maps

1738
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:11,128
to re-imagine Walking Navigation.

1739
01:26:11,128 --> 01:26:13,705
So, here's how it could look in Google Maps.

1740
01:26:13,705 --> 01:26:14,737
Let's take a look.

1741
01:26:15,537 --> 01:26:18,630
- You open the camera...
- (cheering)

1742
01:26:24,148 --> 01:26:27,970
You instantly know where you are.

1743
01:26:27,970 --> 01:26:29,484
No fussing with the phone.

1744
01:26:30,094 --> 01:26:33,563
All the information on the map,
the street names, the directions--

1745
01:26:33,563 --> 01:26:35,207
right there in front of you.

1746
01:26:35,597 --> 01:26:38,992
Notice that you also see the map
so that way you stay oriented.

1747
01:26:40,092 --> 01:26:43,589
You can start to see nearby places--
so you see what's around you.

1748
01:26:43,589 --> 01:26:46,086
(applause)

1749
01:26:46,546 --> 01:26:47,766
And, just for fun,

1750
01:26:47,766 --> 01:26:51,248
our team's been playing with the idea
of adding a helpful guide,

1751
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:52,438
like that there...

1752
01:26:52,438 --> 01:26:53,563
(applause)

1753
01:26:53,563 --> 01:26:55,406
...so that it can show you the way.

1754
01:26:55,406 --> 01:26:58,091
Oh, there she goes! Pretty cool.

1755
01:26:58,501 --> 01:27:01,542
Now, enabling these kinds
of experiences, though,

1756
01:27:01,542 --> 01:27:03,717
GPS alone doesn't cut it.

1757
01:27:03,717 --> 01:27:07,196
So, that's why we've been working on
what we call VPS--

1758
01:27:07,196 --> 01:27:10,013
Visual Positioning System--

1759
01:27:10,013 --> 01:27:13,271
that can estimate precise positioning
and orientation.

1760
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:15,882
One way to think about
the key insight here is,

1761
01:27:15,882 --> 01:27:18,764
just like you and I,
when we're in an unfamiliar place,

1762
01:27:18,764 --> 01:27:20,477
you're looking for visual landmarks.

1763
01:27:20,477 --> 01:27:23,342
You're looking for the storefront,
the building facade, et cetera.

1764
01:27:23,342 --> 01:27:24,608
And it's the same idea.

1765
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:27,907
VPS uses the visual features
in the environment

1766
01:27:27,907 --> 01:27:29,101
to do the same,

1767
01:27:29,101 --> 01:27:31,826
so that way we help you
figure out exactly where you are

1768
01:27:31,826 --> 01:27:34,820
and get you exactly where you need to go.
Pretty cool.

1769
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:38,579
So, that's an example
of how we're using the camera

1770
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:40,694
to help you in Maps.

1771
01:27:40,694 --> 01:27:43,519
But we think the camera
can also help you do more

1772
01:27:43,519 --> 01:27:44,883
with what you see.

1773
01:27:45,413 --> 01:27:48,475
That's why we started working on Google Lens.

1774
01:27:48,475 --> 01:27:52,351
Now, people are already using it
for all sorts of answers,

1775
01:27:52,351 --> 01:27:55,897
and especially when the questions
are difficult to describe in words.

1776
01:27:55,897 --> 01:27:58,741
Answers like, oh, that cute dog in the park--

1777
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:00,430
that's a Labradoodle.

1778
01:28:00,750 --> 01:28:04,026
Or, this building in Chicago
is the Wrigley Building,

1779
01:28:04,026 --> 01:28:06,579
and it's 425 feet tall--

1780
01:28:07,209 --> 01:28:09,606
or, as my 9-year old son says these days,

1781
01:28:09,606 --> 01:28:12,452
"That's more than 60 Kevin Durants!"

1782
01:28:12,452 --> 01:28:13,884
(laughter)

1783
01:28:13,884 --> 01:28:17,131
Now, today Lens has the capability,
in Google products--

1784
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:18,997
like Photos and the Assistant--

1785
01:28:18,997 --> 01:28:21,627
but we're very excited that,
starting next week,

1786
01:28:21,627 --> 01:28:25,682
Lens will be integrated
right inside the camera app

1787
01:28:25,682 --> 01:28:28,890
on the Pixel, the new LG G7,

1788
01:28:28,890 --> 01:28:30,548
and a lot more devices.

1789
01:28:31,048 --> 01:28:33,813
This way, it makes it super easy
for you to use Lens

1790
01:28:33,813 --> 01:28:36,910
on things right in front of you
already in the camera.

1791
01:28:36,910 --> 01:28:38,758
Very excited to see this.

1792
01:28:39,598 --> 01:28:41,188
Now, likewise,

1793
01:28:41,188 --> 01:28:44,741
Vision is a fundamental shift
in computing for us.

1794
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:47,157
And it's a multi-year journey,

1795
01:28:47,157 --> 01:28:49,172
but we're already making a lot of progress,

1796
01:28:49,172 --> 01:28:52,872
so today I thought I'd show you
three new features in Google Lens

1797
01:28:52,872 --> 01:28:56,411
that can give you more answers
to more types of questions,

1798
01:28:56,411 --> 01:28:57,690
more quickly.

1799
01:28:57,690 --> 01:28:59,238
Shall we take a look?

1800
01:28:59,238 --> 01:29:00,344
Alright!

1801
01:29:00,344 --> 01:29:04,530
Okay, first, Lens can now recognize
and understand words.

1802
01:29:04,530 --> 01:29:06,387
Words are everywhere.

1803
01:29:06,387 --> 01:29:09,781
If you think about it--
traffic signs, posters,

1804
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:12,595
restaurant menus, business cards.

1805
01:29:12,595 --> 01:29:15,326
But now, with Smart Text Selection,

1806
01:29:15,326 --> 01:29:17,727
you can now connect the words you see

1807
01:29:17,727 --> 01:29:20,015
with the answers and actions you need.

1808
01:29:20,015 --> 01:29:23,256
So, you can do things like copy and paste

1809
01:29:23,256 --> 01:29:25,027
from the real world

1810
01:29:25,027 --> 01:29:26,704
directly into your phone.

1811
01:29:27,444 --> 01:29:29,838
- Just like that.
- (applause)

1812
01:29:32,807 --> 01:29:35,459
Or, let's say you're looking at--

1813
01:29:35,459 --> 01:29:39,205
or you can turn a page of words
into a page of answers.

1814
01:29:39,205 --> 01:29:42,061
So, for example,
you're looking at a restaurant menu,

1815
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:44,817
you can quickly tap around,
figure out every dish--

1816
01:29:44,817 --> 01:29:47,851
what it looks like,
what are all the ingredients, et cetera.

1817
01:29:48,521 --> 01:29:51,506
By the way, as a vegetarian,
good to know ratatouille

1818
01:29:51,506 --> 01:29:54,197
is just zucchini and tomatoes. (chuckles)

1819
01:29:54,197 --> 01:29:55,876
- (laughter)
- Really cool.

1820
01:29:55,876 --> 01:29:57,289
Now, in these examples,

1821
01:29:57,289 --> 01:30:01,920
Lens is not just understanding the shape
of characters and the letters, visually,

1822
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:06,212
it's actually trying to get at the meaning
and the context behind these words.

1823
01:30:06,212 --> 01:30:08,534
And that's where
all the language understanding

1824
01:30:08,534 --> 01:30:11,636
that you heard Scott talk about
really comes in handy.

1825
01:30:12,646 --> 01:30:15,055
Okay, the next feature I want to talk about

1826
01:30:15,055 --> 01:30:16,737
is called Style Match.

1827
01:30:17,667 --> 01:30:19,068
And the idea is this.

1828
01:30:19,068 --> 01:30:22,461
Sometimes, your question is not,
"Oh, what's that exact thing?"

1829
01:30:22,461 --> 01:30:25,997
Instead, your question is,
"What are things like it?"

1830
01:30:26,487 --> 01:30:29,825
You're at your friend's place,
you check out this trendy looking lamp,

1831
01:30:29,825 --> 01:30:32,608
and you want to know things
that match that style.

1832
01:30:32,608 --> 01:30:34,578
And now, Lens can help you.

1833
01:30:36,188 --> 01:30:39,871
Or, if you see an outfit
that catches your eye,

1834
01:30:39,871 --> 01:30:41,606
you can simply open the camera,

1835
01:30:41,606 --> 01:30:43,902
tap on any item,

1836
01:30:43,902 --> 01:30:46,121
and find out, of course, specific information

1837
01:30:46,121 --> 01:30:48,847
like reviews, et cetera of any specific item,

1838
01:30:48,847 --> 01:30:53,219
but you can also see all the things,
and browse around, that match that style.

1839
01:30:53,879 --> 01:30:56,176
(applause)

1840
01:30:59,662 --> 01:31:01,349
There's two parts to it, of course.

1841
01:31:01,349 --> 01:31:04,070
Lens has to search through
millions and millions of items,

1842
01:31:04,070 --> 01:31:07,547
but we kind of know how to do that search.

1843
01:31:07,547 --> 01:31:09,122
- (laughter)
- But the other part

1844
01:31:09,122 --> 01:31:12,484
actually complicates things,
which is if they can be different textures,

1845
01:31:12,484 --> 01:31:16,058
shapes, sizes, angles,
lighting conditions, et cetera.

1846
01:31:16,058 --> 01:31:17,727
So, it's a tough technical problem.

1847
01:31:17,727 --> 01:31:21,284
But we're making a lot of progress here
and really excited about it.

1848
01:31:21,714 --> 01:31:24,099
So, the last thing
I want to tell you about today

1849
01:31:24,099 --> 01:31:27,716
is how we're making Lens work in real time.

1850
01:31:27,716 --> 01:31:30,435
So, as you saw in the Style Match example,

1851
01:31:30,435 --> 01:31:33,207
you start to see--you open the camera--

1852
01:31:33,207 --> 01:31:35,948
and you start to see
Lens surface proactively

1853
01:31:35,948 --> 01:31:38,193
all the information instantly.

1854
01:31:38,193 --> 01:31:41,790
And it even anchors that information
to the things that you see.

1855
01:31:42,660 --> 01:31:44,063
Now, this kind of thing--

1856
01:31:44,063 --> 01:31:47,106
where it's sifting through billions
of words, phrases, places, things,

1857
01:31:47,106 --> 01:31:49,585
just in real time to give you what you need--

1858
01:31:49,585 --> 01:31:52,997
not possible without machine learning.

1859
01:31:52,997 --> 01:31:55,383
So, we're using both on-device intelligence,

1860
01:31:55,383 --> 01:31:59,156
but also tapping into the power
of cloud TPUs,

1861
01:31:59,156 --> 01:32:02,417
which we announced last year at I/O,
to get this done.

1862
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,500
Really excited.

1863
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:07,869
And over time, what we want to do
is actually overlay the live results

1864
01:32:07,869 --> 01:32:11,484
directly on top of things,
like store fronts, street signs,

1865
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:12,924
or a concert poster.

1866
01:32:13,624 --> 01:32:19,156
So, you can simply point your phone
at a concert poster of Charlie Puth,

1867
01:32:19,156 --> 01:32:21,591
and the music video just starts to play,

1868
01:32:21,591 --> 01:32:22,770
just like that.

1869
01:32:23,990 --> 01:32:28,856
This is an example of how the camera
is not just answering questions,

1870
01:32:28,856 --> 01:32:33,172
but it is putting the answers
right where the questions are.

1871
01:32:33,172 --> 01:32:34,882
And it's very exciting.

1872
01:32:35,792 --> 01:32:38,201
So, Smart Text Selection,

1873
01:32:38,201 --> 01:32:40,389
Style Match, real time results--

1874
01:32:40,389 --> 01:32:43,342
all coming to Lens in the next few weeks.

1875
01:32:43,342 --> 01:32:45,053
Please check them out.

1876
01:32:45,053 --> 01:32:47,748
(applause)

1877
01:32:51,562 --> 01:32:55,966
So, those are some examples
of how Google is applying AI in Camera

1878
01:32:55,966 --> 01:32:58,143
to get things done in the world around you.

1879
01:32:58,593 --> 01:33:03,208
When it comes to applying AI,
mapping, and computer vision

1880
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:05,972
to solving problems in the real world,

1881
01:33:05,972 --> 01:33:09,818
well, it doesn't get more real
than self-driving cars.

1882
01:33:09,818 --> 01:33:11,446
So, to tell you all about it,

1883
01:33:11,446 --> 01:33:16,427
please join me in welcoming
the CEO of Waymo, John Krafcik.

1884
01:33:16,427 --> 01:33:17,437
Thank you.

Hello, everyone!

1888
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:28,793
We're so delighted to join our friends
at Google on stage here today.

1889
01:33:28,793 --> 01:33:31,200
And while this is my first time at Shoreline,

1890
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:34,897
it actually isn't the first time
for our self-driving cars.

1891
01:33:34,897 --> 01:33:36,973
You see, back in 2009,

1892
01:33:36,973 --> 01:33:39,584
in the parking lot just outside this theater,

1893
01:33:39,584 --> 01:33:43,826
some of the very first tests
of self-driving technology took place.

1894
01:33:44,096 --> 01:33:47,690
It was right here
where a group of Google engineers,

1895
01:33:47,690 --> 01:33:50,174
roboticists, and researchers

1896
01:33:50,174 --> 01:33:52,293
set out on a crazy mission

1897
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:55,189
to prove that cars
could actually drive themselves.

1898
01:33:55,849 --> 01:33:58,502
Back then, most people thought 
that self-driving cars

1899
01:33:58,502 --> 01:34:00,504
were nothing more than science fiction.

1900
01:34:01,064 --> 01:34:03,130
But this dedicated team of dreamers

1901
01:34:03,130 --> 01:34:07,338
believed that self-driving vehicles
could make transportation safer,

1902
01:34:07,338 --> 01:34:10,362
easier, and more accessible for everyone.

1903
01:34:11,042 --> 01:34:15,032
And so, the Google
Self-Driving Car Project was born.

1904
01:34:15,032 --> 01:34:17,316
Now, fast-forward to 2018,

1905
01:34:17,316 --> 01:34:19,363
and the Google Self-Driving Car Project

1906
01:34:19,363 --> 01:34:23,876
is now its own, independent
Alphabet company called Waymo.

1907
01:34:24,586 --> 01:34:27,631
And we've moved
well beyond tinkering and research.

1908
01:34:28,081 --> 01:34:32,043
Today, Waymo is the only company in the world

1909
01:34:32,043 --> 01:34:35,536
with a fleet of fully self-driving cars,

1910
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:37,202
with no-one in the driver's seat

1911
01:34:37,202 --> 01:34:38,428
on public roads.

1912
01:34:39,218 --> 01:34:41,607
Now, members of the public
in Phoenix, Arizona,

1913
01:34:41,607 --> 01:34:46,596
have already started to experience some
of these fully self-driving rides, too.

1914
01:34:46,596 --> 01:34:47,782
Let's have a look.

1915
01:34:48,602 --> 01:34:51,881
(man) Okay, Day One of self-driving.
Are you ready?

1916
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:53,832
Go!

1917
01:34:53,832 --> 01:34:55,218
Oh, this is weird.

1918
01:34:55,218 --> 01:34:56,753
(child laughing)

1919
01:34:58,957 --> 01:35:00,607
This is the future. (laughing)

1920
01:35:00,607 --> 01:35:04,252
Yeah, she was like,
"Is there no-one driving that car?"

1922
01:35:05,662 --> 01:35:07,759

It's pretty cool.

1931
01:35:34,646 --> 01:35:38,218
All of these people are part of what
we call the Waymo Early Rider Program,

1932
01:35:38,218 --> 01:35:40,744
where members of the public
use our self-driving cars

1933
01:35:40,744 --> 01:35:42,199
in their daily lives.

1934
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:43,409
Over the last year,

1935
01:35:43,409 --> 01:35:45,986
I've had a chance
to talk to some of these Early Riders

1936
01:35:45,986 --> 01:35:48,564
and their stories
are actually pretty inspiring.

1937
01:35:48,564 --> 01:35:50,426
One of our Early Riders, Neha,

1938
01:35:50,426 --> 01:35:54,088
witnessed a tragic accident
when she was just a young teen,

1939
01:35:54,088 --> 01:35:57,451
which scared her
into never getting her driver's license.

1940
01:35:57,451 --> 01:36:00,444
But now, she takes a Waymo to work every day.

1941
01:36:00,444 --> 01:36:02,094
And there's Jim and Barbara,

1942
01:36:02,094 --> 01:36:05,432
who no longer have to worry
about losing their ability to get around

1943
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:07,022
as they grow older.

1944
01:36:07,382 --> 01:36:09,118
Then, there's the Jackson family.

1945
01:36:09,118 --> 01:36:12,348
Waymo helps them all
navigate their jam-packed schedules,

1946
01:36:12,348 --> 01:36:15,287
taking Kyla and Joseph to and from school,

1947
01:36:15,287 --> 01:36:17,805
practices and meetups with friends.

1948
01:36:18,335 --> 01:36:21,046
So, it's not about science fiction.

1949
01:36:21,426 --> 01:36:24,180
When we talk about
building self-driving technology,

1950
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:26,657
these are the people we're building it for.

1951
01:36:27,387 --> 01:36:33,756
In 2018, self-driving cars are already
transforming the way they live and move.

1952
01:36:34,326 --> 01:36:37,336
So, Phoenix will be the first stop

1953
01:36:37,336 --> 01:36:39,711
for Waymo's Driverless
Transportation Service,

1954
01:36:39,711 --> 01:36:41,547
which is launching later this year.

1955
01:36:41,547 --> 01:36:46,148
Soon, everyone will be able 
to call Waymo, using our app,

1956
01:36:46,148 --> 01:36:49,229
and a fully self-driving car will pull up,

1957
01:36:49,229 --> 01:36:51,087
with no-one in the driver's seat,

1958
01:36:51,087 --> 01:36:53,652
to whisk them away to their destination.

1959
01:36:53,652 --> 01:36:55,146
And that's just the beginning.

1960
01:36:55,146 --> 01:36:56,602
Because, at Waymo,

1961
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:59,478
we're not just building a better car.

1962
01:36:59,478 --> 01:37:02,676
We're building a better driver.

1963
01:37:02,676 --> 01:37:07,085
And that driver can be used
in all kinds of applications--

1964
01:37:07,085 --> 01:37:09,981
ride hailing, logistics, personal cars,

1965
01:37:09,981 --> 01:37:12,172
connecting people to public transportation.

1966
01:37:12,662 --> 01:37:14,635
And we see our technology

1967
01:37:14,635 --> 01:37:17,760
as an enabler
for all of these different industries.

1968
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:21,327
And we intend to partner
with lots of different companies

1969
01:37:21,327 --> 01:37:24,794
to make this self-driving future
a reality for everyone.

1970
01:37:25,684 --> 01:37:27,405
Now, we can enable this future

1971
01:37:27,405 --> 01:37:30,838
because of the breakthroughs
and investments we've made in AI.

1972
01:37:31,318 --> 01:37:32,828
Back in those early days,

1973
01:37:32,828 --> 01:37:35,951
Google was, perhaps,
the only company in the world

1974
01:37:35,951 --> 01:37:39,678
investing in both AI
and self-driving technology

1975
01:37:39,678 --> 01:37:41,400
at the same time.

1976
01:37:41,400 --> 01:37:44,779
So, when Google started making
major advances in machine learning,

1977
01:37:44,779 --> 01:37:48,414
with speech recognition, computer vision,
image search, and more--

1978
01:37:48,414 --> 01:37:51,451
Waymo was in a unique position to benefit.

1979
01:37:51,451 --> 01:37:54,043
For example, back in 2013,

1980
01:37:54,043 --> 01:37:56,216
we were looking for a breakthrough technology

1981
01:37:56,216 --> 01:37:59,509
to help us with pedestrian detection.

1982
01:37:59,509 --> 01:38:00,812
Luckily for us,

1983
01:38:00,812 --> 01:38:04,460
Google was already deploying
a new technique called deep learning,

1984
01:38:04,460 --> 01:38:07,737
a type of machine learning that allows you
to create neural networks,

1985
01:38:07,737 --> 01:38:10,849
with multiple layers,
to solve more complex problems.

1986
01:38:10,849 --> 01:38:14,953
So, our self-driving engineers
teamed up with researchers

1987
01:38:14,953 --> 01:38:16,569
from the Google Brain team,

1988
01:38:16,569 --> 01:38:18,999
and within a matter of months

1989
01:38:18,999 --> 01:38:24,317
we reduced the error rate
for detecting pedestrians by 100x.

1990
01:38:24,317 --> 01:38:27,915
That's right-- not 100%, but a hundred times.

1991
01:38:28,915 --> 01:38:30,788

unlocking our ability
to go truly self-driving.

01:38:58,006 --> 01:39:01,170
Good morning, everyone.
It's great to be here.

2001
01:39:01,170 --> 01:39:04,721
Now, at Waymo,
AI touches every part of our system,

2002
01:39:04,721 --> 01:39:07,852
from perception to prediction
to decision-making to mapping,

2003
01:39:07,852 --> 01:39:09,252
and so much more.

2004
01:39:09,702 --> 01:39:12,007
To be a capable and safe driver,

2005
01:39:12,007 --> 01:39:16,029
our cars need a deep semantic
understanding of the world around them.

2006
01:39:16,029 --> 01:39:18,824
Our vehicles need to understand
and classify objects,

2007
01:39:18,824 --> 01:39:21,409
interpret their movements,
reason about intent,

2008
01:39:21,409 --> 01:39:23,584
and predict what they will do in the future.

2009
01:39:23,584 --> 01:39:25,159
They need to understand

2010
01:39:25,159 --> 01:39:28,145
how each object
interacts with everything else.

2011
01:39:28,145 --> 01:39:31,472
And, finally, our cars need 
to use all that information

2012
01:39:31,472 --> 01:39:33,809
to act in a safe and predictable manner.

2013
01:39:33,809 --> 01:39:34,982
So, needless to say,

2014
01:39:34,982 --> 01:39:37,993
there's a lot that goes 
into building a self-driving car.

2015
01:39:37,993 --> 01:39:40,926
And today I want to tell you about two areas

2016
01:39:40,926 --> 01:39:43,437
where AI has made a huge impact--

2017
01:39:43,437 --> 01:39:45,977
perception and prediction.

2018
01:39:46,747 --> 01:39:48,378
So, first perception.

2019
01:39:48,378 --> 01:39:51,354
Detecting and classifying objects
is a key part of driving.

2020
01:39:51,354 --> 01:39:53,883
Pedestrians, in particular,
pose a unique challenge

2021
01:39:53,883 --> 01:39:57,402
because they come in all kinds of shapes,
postures, and sizes.

2022
01:39:57,402 --> 01:39:59,815
So, for example, here's a construction worker

2023
01:39:59,815 --> 01:40:01,337
peeking out of a manhole,

2024
01:40:01,337 --> 01:40:03,006
with most of his body obscured.

2025
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:07,468
Here's a pedestrian crossing the street,
concealed by a plank of wood.

2026
01:40:07,928 --> 01:40:09,188
And here...

2027
01:40:09,188 --> 01:40:13,139
we have pedestrians who are dressed
in inflatable dinosaur costumes.

2028
01:40:13,139 --> 01:40:15,169
(laughter)

2029
01:40:15,169 --> 01:40:18,034
Now, we haven't taught our cars
about the Jurassic period,

2030
01:40:18,034 --> 01:40:20,107
but can still classify them correctly.

2031
01:40:20,107 --> 01:40:22,435
We can detect and classify these pedestrians

2032
01:40:22,435 --> 01:40:24,275
because we apply deep nets

2033
01:40:24,275 --> 01:40:26,280
to a combination of sensory data.

2034
01:40:26,820 --> 01:40:28,535
Traditionally, in computer vision,

2035
01:40:28,535 --> 01:40:32,157
neural networks are used
just in camera images and video.

2036
01:40:32,157 --> 01:40:35,044
But our cars have a lot more
than just cameras.

2037
01:40:35,044 --> 01:40:38,735
We also have lasers
to measure distance and shapes of objects,

2038
01:40:38,735 --> 01:40:40,796
and radars to measure their speed.

2039
01:40:40,796 --> 01:40:44,487
And, by applying machine learning
to this combination of sensor data,

2040
01:40:44,487 --> 01:40:48,559
we can accurately detect pedestrians
in all forms, in real time.

2041
01:40:50,069 --> 01:40:54,670
A second area where machine learning
has been incredibly powerful for Waymo

2042
01:40:54,670 --> 01:40:57,072
is predicting how people
will behave on the road.

2043
01:40:57,572 --> 01:41:01,949
Now, sometimes, people do
exactly what you expect them to,

2044
01:41:01,949 --> 01:41:04,433
and, sometimes, they don't.

2045
01:41:04,433 --> 01:41:06,918
Take this example
of a car running a red light.

2046
01:41:14,619 --> 01:41:17,588
Unfortunately, we see this kind of thing
more than we'd like.

2047
01:41:17,588 --> 01:41:20,673
But let me break this down
from the car's point of view.

2048
01:41:20,673 --> 01:41:23,557
Our car is about to proceed
straight through an intersection.

2049
01:41:23,557 --> 01:41:25,446
We have a clear green light,

2050
01:41:25,446 --> 01:41:27,631
and cross traffic
is stopped with a red light.

2051
01:41:28,511 --> 01:41:30,508
But, just as we enter the intersection,

2052
01:41:30,508 --> 01:41:34,699
all the way in the right corner,
we see a vehicle coming fast.

2053
01:41:34,699 --> 01:41:37,466
Our models understand
that this is unusual behavior

2054
01:41:37,466 --> 01:41:40,010
for a vehicle that should be decelerating.

2055
01:41:40,010 --> 01:41:42,214
We predict the car will run the red light.

2056
01:41:42,214 --> 01:41:44,869
So, we preemptively slow down--

2057
01:41:44,869 --> 01:41:47,196
which you can see here with this red fence--

2058
01:41:47,196 --> 01:41:50,294
and this gives the red light runner
room to pass in front of us

2059
01:41:50,294 --> 01:41:53,212
while it barely avoids
hitting another vehicle.

2060
01:41:53,992 --> 01:41:55,674
We can detect this kind of anomaly

2061
01:41:55,674 --> 01:41:59,446
because we've trained our ML models
using lots of examples.

2062
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:04,401
Today, our fleet has self-driven
more than 6 million miles

2063
01:42:04,401 --> 01:42:05,591
on public roads,

2064
01:42:05,591 --> 01:42:09,146
which means we've seen hundreds
of millions of real world interactions.

2065
01:42:09,466 --> 01:42:13,428
To put that in perspective,
we drive more miles each day

2066
01:42:13,428 --> 01:42:16,077
than the average American drives in a year.

2067
01:42:17,387 --> 01:42:20,268
Now, it takes more than good algorithms

2068
01:42:20,268 --> 01:42:22,257
to build a self-driving car.

2069
01:42:22,257 --> 01:42:24,861
We also need really powerful infrastructure.

2070
01:42:25,271 --> 01:42:28,104
And, at Waymo,
we use the TensorFlow ecosystem

2071
01:42:28,104 --> 01:42:30,739
and Google's data centers, including TPUs,

2072
01:42:30,739 --> 01:42:32,286
to train our neural networks.

2073
01:42:32,946 --> 01:42:35,691
And with TPUs, we can now train our nets

2074
01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:37,973
up to 15 times more efficiently.

2075
01:42:38,743 --> 01:42:40,862
We also use this powerful infrastructure

2076
01:42:40,862 --> 01:42:43,737
to validate our models in simulation.

2077
01:42:43,737 --> 01:42:45,763
And in this virtual world,

2078
01:42:45,763 --> 01:42:49,555
we're driving the equivalent of 25,000 cars

2079
01:42:49,555 --> 01:42:51,428
all day, every day.

2080
01:42:51,918 --> 01:42:56,662
All told, we've driven
more than 5 billion miles in simulation.

2081
01:42:57,552 --> 01:42:58,919
And with this kind of scale,

2082
01:42:58,919 --> 01:43:02,033
both in training
and validation of our models,

2083
01:43:02,033 --> 01:43:05,104
we can quickly and efficiently
teach our cars new skills.

2084
01:43:05,714 --> 01:43:08,389
And one skill we started to tackle

2085
01:43:08,389 --> 01:43:10,760
is self-driving in difficult weather,

2086
01:43:10,760 --> 01:43:13,508
such as snow, as you see here.

2087
01:43:13,508 --> 01:43:14,848
(applause)

2088
01:43:14,848 --> 01:43:16,746
And today, for the first time,

2089
01:43:16,746 --> 01:43:18,898
I want to show you a behind-the-scenes look

2090
01:43:18,898 --> 01:43:21,664
at what it's like for our cars
to self-drive in snow.

2091
01:43:22,664 --> 01:43:25,511
This is what our car sees
before we apply any filtering.

2092
01:43:25,511 --> 01:43:26,834
(laughter)

2093
01:43:26,834 --> 01:43:28,530
Driving in a snowstorm can be tough

2094
01:43:28,530 --> 01:43:31,505
because snowflakes
can create a lot of noise for our sensors.

2095
01:43:31,905 --> 01:43:35,521
But when we apply
machine learning to this data,

2096
01:43:35,521 --> 01:43:37,182
this is what our car sees.

2097
01:43:37,542 --> 01:43:40,929
We can clearly identify
each of these vehicles,

2098
01:43:40,929 --> 01:43:42,917
even through all of the sensor noise.

2099
01:43:43,127 --> 01:43:46,118
And the quicker we can unlock
these types of advanced capabilities,

2100
01:43:46,118 --> 01:43:48,317
the quicker
we can bring our self-driving cars

2101
01:43:48,317 --> 01:43:50,023
to more cities around the world,

2102
01:43:50,023 --> 01:43:51,873
and to a city near you.

2103
01:43:51,873 --> 01:43:54,488
We can't wait to make our self-driving cars

2104
01:43:54,488 --> 01:43:56,332
available to more people,

2105
01:43:56,332 --> 01:43:57,779
moving us closer to a future

2106
01:43:57,779 --> 01:44:02,413
where roads are safer, easier
and more accessible for everyone.

2107
01:44:02,413 --> 01:44:03,758

Thanks, Dmitri.

2113
01:44:22,866 --> 01:44:25,927
It's a great reminder of how AI
can play a role in helping people

2114
01:44:25,927 --> 01:44:27,763
in new ways all the time.

2115
01:44:28,623 --> 01:44:32,206
I started at Google as an engineering intern

2116
01:44:32,206 --> 01:44:33,749
almost 19 years ago.

2117
01:44:34,179 --> 01:44:38,662
And what struck me from almost
the very first day I walked in the door,

2118
01:44:38,662 --> 01:44:42,824
was the commitment to push the boundaries

2119
01:44:42,824 --> 01:44:45,183
and what was possible with technology,

2120
01:44:45,183 --> 01:44:49,014
combined with a deep focus
on building products

2121
01:44:49,014 --> 01:44:51,997
that had a real impact on people lives.

2122
01:44:52,707 --> 01:44:55,173
And, as the years have passed,
I've seen, time and again,

2123
01:44:55,173 --> 01:44:58,346
how technology
can play a really transformative role,

2124
01:44:58,346 --> 01:45:00,924
from the earliest days
of things like Search and Maps,

2125
01:45:00,924 --> 01:45:03,201
to new experiences,
like the Google Assistant.

2126
01:45:03,601 --> 01:45:07,545
As I look at the Google of today,
I see those same early values

2127
01:45:07,545 --> 01:45:09,053
alive and well.

2128
01:45:09,963 --> 01:45:11,390
We continue to work hard,

2129
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:13,042
together with all of you,

2130
01:45:13,042 --> 01:45:15,640
to build products for everyone,

2131
01:45:15,640 --> 01:45:17,693
and products that matter.

2132
01:45:18,433 --> 01:45:21,537
We constantly aspire
to raise the bar for ourselves even higher

2133
01:45:21,537 --> 01:45:24,571
and to contribute to the world and to society

2134
01:45:24,571 --> 01:45:26,773
in a responsible way.

2135
01:45:26,773 --> 01:45:29,577
Now, we know
that to truly build for everyone,

2136
01:45:29,577 --> 01:45:32,466
we need lots of perspectives in the mix.

2137
01:45:32,466 --> 01:45:34,531
And so that's why we broadened I/O this year

2138
01:45:34,531 --> 01:45:37,104
to include an even wider range of voices.

2139
01:45:37,104 --> 01:45:40,511
We've invited additional speakers
over the next three days

2140
01:45:40,511 --> 01:45:43,927
to talk to you all about the broader role
that technology can play

2141
01:45:43,927 --> 01:45:46,379
in everything
from promoting digital wellbeing,

2142
01:45:46,379 --> 01:45:50,604
to empowering NGOs to achieve their missions,

2143
01:45:50,604 --> 01:45:51,656

that you've come to expect from us at I/O

2145
01:45:54,790 --> 01:45:57,446
