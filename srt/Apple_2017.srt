2
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:22,700
there's lots of waysto be as a person 

3
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:27,500
 and some people express their deep 

4
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:34,640
appreciation in indifferent ways but 

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:37,430
 one of the ways that I believe people 

6
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:40,309
express theirappreciation to to the 

7
00:00:40,309 --> 00:00:43,309
rest ofhumanity is to make something 

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:46,839
wonderfuland put it out there and you 

9
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,510
never you never meet the people you 

10
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,940
never shake their hands 

11
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:54,650
you never hear their story ortell yours 

12
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,439
but somehow in the act ofmaking 

13
00:00:57,439 --> 00:00:59,869
something with a great dealof care and 

14
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:00,470
love

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:07,340
something's transmitted there and it's a 

16
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,439
wayof expressing to the rest of our 

17
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:16,640
 species our deep appreciation so we need 

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,840
to be trueto who we are and remember 

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,410
what'sreally important to us that's 

20
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,560
what's gonna keep Apple Appleis if we 

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,490

fitting thatSteve should open his

37
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,459

41
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,560
 his appreciation for Humanity would not 

42
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:31,280
be asingular product but rather it 

43
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,260

Retail has always been about more than

give youan update on retail and to do 

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,940
thatI'd like to invite Angela Angela 

143
00:09:55,769 --> 00:10:02,050
good morning thank you it's greatto be 

144
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:06,579
here and I love the fact thatthe same 

145
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:10,089
team thatdesigns Apple Park also 

146
00:10:10,089 --> 00:10:12,519
designs our largest retail stores around 

147
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,760
the world but it's funny because we 

148
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,320
actuallydon't call them stores anymore 

149
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,560
we call them town squaresbecause 

150
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:24,279
they'regathering places for 500 million 

151
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,570
people who visit us every year places 

152
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,029
where everyone's welcomeand where all 

153
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:35,170
of Apple comes togetherbut what really 

154
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,000
brings it all to life is Tim saidare 

155
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,060
our incredible teams we've always said

156
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,810
that our people of our soul and they're 

157
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:46,300
 Apple's greatest differentiator because 

158
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,220
theybring personal connection to 

159
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,529
communities all overthe world they 

160
00:10:50,529 --> 00:10:54,459
humanizetechnology but along with our 

161
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:57,010
 amazing teams our commitment to design 

162
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,680
 also sets us apart 

163
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,279
tomake things simple beautiful and 

164
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,420
that's why we thinkof Apple retail as 

165
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,579
Apple's largest productsand like all of 

166
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:12,190
 our products we've designed new features 

167
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,170
to take the customer experience even 

168
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:17,649
further in our largest cities where we 

169
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:20,920
can wecreate a Plaza a space open to 

170
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,860
 everyone come in and relax meet up with 

171
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,140
friends or just listen to a local artist 

172
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,380
on the weekends inside we've designed a

173
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,779
foruma place for customers to come and 

174
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,810
create collaborate or just connect again 

175
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,500
with one another for local entrepreneurs 

176
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,899
and app developers we have a quieter

177
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,819
space in the larger stores called a

178
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:43,360
boardroom

179
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,130
where they can learn morefrom our teams 

180
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:49,300
 or again share with each other and the 

181
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:52,990
genius growth a redesigned more relaxed 

182
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,420
service service experience now in the 

183
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,660
heart ofour largest stores and lastly 

184
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:02,620

 great and it's it's really inspiring to 

382
00:22:45,549 --> 00:22:47,500
us that so many peopleare getting 

383
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:50,200
healthier with Apple watchwith watch OS 

384
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,549
4 they're gonna be able to do even more 

385
00:22:51,549 --> 00:22:54,130
we're addingsmart activity coaching 

386
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:55,960
which isgonna help more people close 

387
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,720
more rings more oftena completely 

388
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,179
 redesigned workout app with high 

389
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,520
 intensity interval training new features 

390
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,539
for swimmers likeAuto sets and gym kick 

391
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,330
an industry-firstit's really simple you 

392
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:12,190
just tap your watch on the machine get 

393
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,700
goingand all your metrics are in sync 

394
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,860
 what one of the things that enables 

395
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:20,230
thesefitness features is the apple 

396
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,600
heart rate sensorand it's been at the 

397
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,789
coreof Apple watch since the very 

398
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,820
beginningand today it's the most used 

399
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,940
 heartrate monitor in the world and we 

400
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,860
wantto use it to help even more people 

401
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:36,490
 so we're doing three things first we're 

402
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,020
making enhancements to the heartrate app 

403
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,289
to give you moreinformation now you'll 

404
00:23:41,289 --> 00:23:42,730
see yourheart rate right on the watch 

405
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:44,260
face so you cankeep an eye on it with 

406
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,450
just a raise of the wrist and when you 

407
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:48,760
launch theheart rate app you'll see new 

408
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,080
measurements like resting heart rate

409
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,640
 Apple watch calculates this daily by 

410
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,960
 correlating background heart rate 

411
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,529
readings with accelerometer dataand 

412
00:23:58,529 --> 00:24:00,580
recovery heart rate which tells you how

413
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,200
 quickly your heart rate drops after 

414
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,840
workout a lower restingheart rate and a 

415
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,120
quicker recovery rate can be signs of

416
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:10,149
improvedfitness and now you can keep a 

417
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:11,649
 better picture of your heart rate you'll 

418
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:14,010
have a better picturethroughout the day 

419
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,510
the second thing we weredoing 

420
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,130
is inspiredby many of the letters we 

421
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:21,080
receivedfrom customers who notice an 

422
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,000
unusually high heart rate when they

423
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,490
wouldn't expect oneso Apple watch has 

424
00:24:25,490 --> 00:24:27,500
beenhelpful for them but we realize 

425
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,650
mostpeople won't notice so we're adding 

426
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:34,430
a featureand now Apple watch will 

427
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:36,980
notify youwhen it detects an elevated 

428
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,530
heartrate you and you don't appear to 

429
00:24:39,530 --> 00:24:50,120
be active and thethird thing we're 

430
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,930
doing is focused onheart rhythm our 

431
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,150
regular heart rhythm hasa familiar 

432
00:24:56,150 --> 00:24:57,980
patternbut when your heart beats 

433
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,140
 irregularly it's called an arrhythmia it 

434
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,730
doesn't mean it's beating toofast or 

435
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,290
tooslow it just means it's beating out 

436
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:06,380
of its normal rhythm and that can cause 

437
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:09,110
problems the most common form of serious 

438
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,520
arrhythmia is called atrialfibrillation 

439
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,610
or afiband it affects tens of millions 

440
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,500
of peopleand is a leading cause of 

441
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,860
 stroke but the challenge is many people 

442
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,840
withafib don't feel symptoms so it 

443
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:23,720
oftengoes undiagnosed we've been 

444
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,370
looking at thisfor a couple of years 

445
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,490
 and we think Apple watch can help in our 

446
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,200
initial studies Apple watch hasbeen 

447
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,770
effective at surfacing irregular rhythms

448
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:35,180
so we're expanding that work and today 

449
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:39,760
 we're announcing the Apple heart study 

450
00:25:45,159 --> 00:25:49,490
it will use datafrom Apple watch and it 

451
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,620
willanalyze arrhythmias including afib 

452
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,559
 and notify users this study is being 

453
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,090
conductedin partnership with Stanford 

454
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:58,220
medicineand we're working closely with 

455
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,600
the FDAand they've been great to work 

456
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,169
with so later this year the first phase 

457
00:26:03,169 --> 00:26:04,940
of theApple heart study will be 

458
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:08,110
availablein the US on the App Store 

459
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:11,120
those are the updates focused on fitness 

460
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,750
andhealth and they join the other great 

461
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:17,029
features ofwatch OS 4 we have a 

462
00:26:17,029 --> 00:26:19,750
completely redesignedmusic experience 

463
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,330
an intelligent Siri face fun new

464
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:27,080
characters fromToy Story and more so 

465
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,270
that's watch OS 4 it will be available 

466
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,159
 to all Apple watch customers on 

467
00:26:31,159 --> 00:26:34,390
September 19

468
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:45,450
and now I'd liketo introduce the next 

469
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:48,950
 generation of Apple watch 

470
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:57,710
[Music]

471
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:13,630
[Music]

472
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:23,170
[Music]

473
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,250
introducing Applewatch Series three and 

474
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:43,860

477
00:27:54,909 --> 00:27:56,980
been our vision fromthe very beginning 

478
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,230
 and we believe built-in Cellular makes 

479
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:01,840

480
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,779

music youneed to stay motivated what to 

511
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:37,500
enable thesefeatures on Apple watch we 

512
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,770
havepacked Series three with the most 

513
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:44,150
advanced technologies ever in a watch

514
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,250
 inside is a new dual-core processor 

515
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:49,890
delivering up to70% more more 

516
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,280
performance it's really really fastSiri 

517
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,250
 is quicker than ever and thanks to the 

518
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,800
new processorfor the first time on 

519
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:03,000
Apple watchSiri can talk it's 64 

520
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,860
degrees right nowin South Lake Tahoe 

521
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:07,230
 it's actually it's really convenient to 

522
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:09,030
not have to look at the screenwhen you 

523
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,020
ask it a questionfor Bluetooth and 

524
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,000
Wi-Fi connectivitywe developed a custom 

525
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,130
wireless chip we callw2 there's nothing 

526
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:19,430
else like it it delivers upto 85% 

527
00:30:19,430 --> 00:30:22,560
 faster Wi-Fi while being 50% more power 

528
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:25,170
 power efficient for both Bluetooth and 

529
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:27,900
Wi-Fiand we've added a barometric 

530
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,510
altimeterso now you get flights of 

531
00:30:30,510 --> 00:30:32,370
stairs climbed and elevation gains after

532
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:35,220
a workout we're also releasing an app 

533
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,900
for developers thiscan be great for 

534
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:41,660
skiingand snowboarding apps of course 

535
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:45,250
got a snowboarder out there

536
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:47,840
of course the biggest challenge of all

537
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,740
 was adding cellular you see our little 

538
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,650
watch isalready packed and you have to 

539
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,250
add antennas radios power amplifiers a

540
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:01,340
SIM cardand if you don't do it right it 

541
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,530
 gets so big it looks like a house arrest 

542
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,450
bracelet and you're not going to want to

543
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:09,350
 wear it so our engineers have been hard 

544
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:12,049
at workand they've come up with some 

545
00:31:12,049 --> 00:31:14,679
really creative solutions forexample 

546
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,200
 rather than add an antenna the display 

547
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,330
itselfis the multi frequency antenna 

548
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,919
for both LTE andUMTS and of course you 

549
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,870
have to havea SIM card but even a nano 

550
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:30,590
 SIM would be way too big so instead we 

551
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:32,929
integrated an electronicSIM and it's a 

552
00:31:32,929 --> 00:31:37,159
fractionof the size so here's where we 

553
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:39,049
endedup even with all these new 

554
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,590
features faster dual-core processor w2

555
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:45,740
altimeterall the stuff you've got to 

556
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:48,320
put in for cellular the case for series

557
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:54,039
3 is the same size as series 2 

558
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,640
theonly difference is we extended the 

559
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,220
back crystalamir 0.25 millimeters 

560
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,530
 that's as thin as two sheets of paper 

561
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:13,310
 it's it's really magical to make a 

562
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,560
stand-alone call on a device this small 

563
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,360

00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,490
been a few key inflection pointsthat 

682
00:40:13,490 --> 00:40:14,809
have changed the way weexperience 

683
00:40:14,809 --> 00:40:17,690
television it of course all began with 

684
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:20,000
black-and-white and it was first 

685
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,069
transformed with the introduction of

686
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:25,460
color it took a hugestep forward with 

687
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,359
 the advent of HD each stage brought with

691
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:45,140
themost stunning visuals ever that are 

692
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,599

that's why I am so excitedto introduce 

697
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:05,619
Apple TV 4k

698
00:41:09,950 --> 00:41:14,450
at the heart ofApple TV 4k are two key 

699
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,910
technologies that are drivingthis next 

700
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:19,910
evolution of the TVexperience and to 

701
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,490
tell you allabout them I'd like to 

702
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:26,440
inviteEddie to the stage Eddie 

703
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,780
thank you Tim itis really great to be 

704
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:33,920
here tonight Apple TV 4k is incredible 

705
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,410
and it starts with two big advancements 

706
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:41,180
in picture qualityfirst is 4k let me 

707
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:44,839
show you this is an imageand 4k it's 

708
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:47,720
got incredible detail that's possible

709
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,940
because4k has four times the number of 

710
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,640
pixelsas HD but resolution isn't 

711
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,440
 everything there's an even bigger 

712
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,150
advancement that's more important and

713
00:41:56,150 --> 00:41:59,619
it's called high dynamicrange or HDR 

714
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:02,510
while 4k is about the number of pixels 

715
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,780
 HDR is about better pixels let me show 

716
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,619
youhere's that same 4k image and here 

717
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:15,859
itis an HDR look at the color the 

718
00:42:15,859 --> 00:42:18,920
detailsApple TV can do this because it 

719
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,589
supportsthe industry standard HDR 10 as 

720
00:42:21,589 --> 00:42:24,319
wellas Dolby vision the best HDR 

721

have had the impact on the world that 

915
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:29,440
the iPhone has nothingelse has become 

916
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:32,350
so essential or put so much power into

917
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:36,760
somany people's hands than iPhone it's 

918
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:41,380
trulyamazing how much iPhone impacts 

919
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:44,370
the worldeach and every day our 

920
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:47,350
intention with iPhone has always been 

921
00:53:47,350 --> 00:53:50,860
ableto been to create something so 

922
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,400
powerfulso immersive and so magical 

923
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,990
 that the hardware virtually disappears 

924
00:53:57,990 --> 00:54:00,550
over thelast 10 years we've reimagined 

925
00:54:00,550 --> 00:54:04,000
or invented numerous technologies to 

926
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,930
createjust that experience the first 

927
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:11,080
iPhoneforever changed how we interact 

928
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,790
 with technology by introducing 

929
00:54:12,790 --> 00:54:16,690
 multi-touch for the first time you were 

930
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:19,900
actuallytouching the software instead 

931
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,220
of buttonsit was magical the app store 

932
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:26,940
changed the way wework play learn 

933
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,710
communicate spawning new companies and

934
00:54:29,710 --> 00:54:34,030
 new industries along the way we took the 

935
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:36,130
viewing experience to places literally

936
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,070
never seenbefore with technologies like 

937
00:54:39,070 --> 00:54:43,120
theRetina display we change the way 

938
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,510
people communicate with features like 

939
00:54:45,510 --> 00:54:48,400
iMessage and FaceTimethat allowed us 

940
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:50,560
 all to connect in more meaningful ways 

941
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:56,230
 and with Siri we used artificial 

942
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:58,120
intelligence tomake our voices more 

943
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:03,010
powerful iPhone even revolutionized

944
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:07,930
security and privacy with touch ID and

945
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:12,660
our walletswith Apple pay and of course 

946
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,700
 iPhone put amazing easy-to-use cameras 

947
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:18,070
into our hands becoming the mostpopular 

948
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:22,800
way to capture the images of our lives 

949
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:26,320
over the pastdecade we pushed forward 

950
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:28,900
with innovation after innovation after

951
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:35,490
innovationbringing us to this moment 

952
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,760
 when now we can create devices that are 

953
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:42,790
far moreintelligent far more capable 

954
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:46,050

processmaking sure there's a beautiful 

976
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:37,790
precisehue and the glass is further 

977
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:40,160
reinforced by an internal laser welded

978
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:43,460
steel and copperstructure we're so 

979
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,050
excited because this glass is the most 

980
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:51,020
durableever in a smartphone iPhone 8 

981
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:53,420
 and a plus is also microscopically 

982
00:57:53,420 --> 00:57:56,920
sealed for water and dust resistance and

983
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:59,810
they have a new retina HD display in

accuracyand they have great wide cinema 

989
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:17,119
quality color gamutwe've built in our 

990
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,790
3dtouch technology into the display and 

991
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:21,980
 for the first time in an iPhone display 

992
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,800
it is our true tone technologynow with 

993
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,210
true tone it adapts thecolor 

994
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:28,910
temperatureand intensity to the ambient 

995
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:31,820
light around us alongwith the displays 

996
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:33,800
 iPhone 8 and 8 plus have new stereo 

997
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:36,290
speakers as wellthey're 25 percent 

998
00:58:36,290 --> 00:58:38,640
louder than the speakersat iPhone 7 

999
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:43,829
and they have a deeperbase too and this 

1000
00:58:43,829 --> 00:58:44,910
 is pretty incredible 

1001
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:47,910
insideiPhone 8 and 8 plus is a brand 

1002
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:49,200
new chip and thisis a breakthrough 

1003
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,259
performance in a mobiledevice we call 

1004
00:58:52,259 --> 00:59:03,089
it a11 Bionic this is the most powerful 

1005
00:59:03,089 --> 00:59:06,559
and smartest chipever in a smartphone 

1006
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,690
 it's a 64-bit design 4.3 billion 

1007
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:12,420
transistorssix core we're gonna geek 

1008
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:13,920
out here for a bit because itis so 

1009
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,140
awesomeit has two high-performance 

1010
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:18,539
coursethey're 25% faster than the high 

1011
00:59:18,539 --> 00:59:20,099
 performance course and the previous 

1012
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,920
industry-leading810 chip is for high 

1013
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,019
efficiency coursethey're up to 70% 

1014
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:27,390
 faster than the ones in the a-10 chip 

1015
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,430
 they're managed by our second generation 

1016
00:59:29,430 --> 00:59:31,470
performance controllerthat now can use 

1017
00:59:31,470 --> 00:59:33,869
all six cores at onceit can deliver up 

1018
00:59:33,869 --> 00:59:35,339
to 70 percent improvement in 

1019
00:59:35,339 --> 00:59:40,109
 multi-threaded workloads and they have 

1020
00:59:40,109 --> 00:59:43,109
our first ever Apple design graphics 

1021
00:59:43,109 --> 00:59:45,509
processing unitor GPU this is a three 

1022
00:59:45,509 --> 00:59:48,029
core designit's 30% faster than the 

1023
00:59:48,029 --> 00:59:51,450
graphics in the previous a 10 and the

1024
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:54,119
GPU is designed to accelerate 3d apps

1025
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:56,039
and gamesespecially those that use our 

1026
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,609
new metal2 framework and the GPU also 

1027
00:59:59,609 --> 01:00:01,710
is incrediblefor machine learning apps 

1028
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:04,289
and those kind of tasksget a big speed 

1029
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:06,119
up if they use ourour core machine 

1030
01:00:06,119 --> 01:00:10,319
learning framework- there's more to it 

1031
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,319
the 11 Bionic includes our first new 

1032
01:00:13,319 --> 01:00:15,720
generation image signal processor orISP 

1033
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:17,039
so you know this isusing photography 

1034
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:19,529
the delivers faster autofocus in 

1035
01:00:19,529 --> 01:00:20,390
low-light

1036
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:23,489
it has new pixel processingfor 

1037
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:26,460
sharpnessand texture and for the first 

1038
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,470
 time to help reduce noise it is Hardware 

1039
01:00:28,470 --> 01:00:32,430
 enabled multiband noise reduction all 

1040
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:34,499
this helps to improveperformance and 

1041
01:00:34,499 --> 01:00:37,319
helps us take better picturesperhaps 

1042
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:38,970
the most beloved feature of everynew 

1043
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:41,130
generationof iPhone is the cameras and 

1044
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:43,890
people lovetaking photos and customers 

1045
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,599
 sent us their photos for our shot on 

1046
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:48,210
iphone campaign likethis one this was 

1047
01:00:48,210 --> 01:00:50,369
sentfrom Jeremy Perez Cruz he shot it 

1048
01:00:50,369 --> 01:00:51,770
with aniPhone 

1049
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:54,290
Plus and people gonnalove taking 

1050
01:00:54,290 --> 01:00:56,480
pictureswith the iPhone 8 camera it is 

1051
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:59,030
an all-new 12 megapixel sensor it's 

1052
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:03,020
larger and fasterit provides 83 percent 

1053
01:01:03,020 --> 01:01:06,320
more lightand it provides more it's 

1054
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,330
morepower efficient at the same time it 

1055
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:10,910
isdeeper pixels and a new color filter 

1056
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,250
so this adds up tohaving better color 

1057
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:15,890
saturationa wider dynamic range of 

1058
01:01:15,890 --> 01:01:18,620
colorand lower noise in your photos and 

1059
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:22,370
videosI phone 8 plus has two new 

1060
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:24,620
sensors in its dual camera the

1061
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:26,750
wide-anglecamera has an F 1.8 aperture 

1062
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:29,210
and optical image stabilizationthe 

1063
01:01:29,210 --> 01:01:33,140
telephotocamera has F 2.8 aperture so 

1064
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:34,820
as alwayswe want to show you the kind 

1065
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:36,950
of photos you can take off of our new 

1066
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:38,900
camerasnow these are photos we're going 

1067
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:40,280
to show thathave not been retouched in 

1068
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:41,930
any way they're straight off the iPhone

1069
01:01:41,930 --> 01:01:44,560
8and 8 plus so here's the first one 

1070
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:47,810
thisis absolutely beautiful now that's 

1071
01:01:47,810 --> 01:01:49,430
notthe Golden Gate Bridge this is taken 

1072
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,920
in Portugal it shows the beauty of wide

1073
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:54,340
color gamutthere's great dynamic range 

1074
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,200
 sharpness and incredibly low noise just 

1075
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,110
look atthat blue sky here's another 

1076
01:02:00,110 --> 01:02:00,650
example

1077
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:03,170
it shows incredible Y qualitycolor 

1078
01:02:03,170 --> 01:02:05,780
again just look at the skin tones and

1079
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,150
 the detail and the hair in the eyes if 

1080
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:09,860
you look closely in her eyesyou can 

1081
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:11,720
actually see the photographer reflected 

1082
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:13,430
there holdingan iPhone to take the 

1083
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:16,310
picture here's a greatexample of the 

1084
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:18,290
amazingtextures in depth and 

1085
01:02:18,290 --> 01:02:20,150
photographyyou can really feel the 

1086
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:22,820
fabric and you can see details in their 

1087
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:26,090
face behindthe fabric here's a great 

1088
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,940
example of low-light photography texture 

1089
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,160
detail and verysubtle colors in this 

1090
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:34,310
darker environmentlast year we 

1091
01:02:34,310 --> 01:02:36,920
introduced portrait mode iPhone8 takes 

1092
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,950
fantastic portrait modesand people flip 

1093
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,900
over taking these photos and now with 

1094
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:43,160
the iPhone 8 plus you'regonna get 

1095
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:45,650
sharper details more uses inlow-light 

1096
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:47,780
 and even a more natural bokeh in the 

1097
01:02:47,780 --> 01:02:50,090
background of the photosso this is a 

1098
01:02:50,090 --> 01:02:52,070
big hitwe had a surprise new feature 

1099
01:02:52,070 --> 01:02:54,110
last year of portrait mode we brought it

1100
01:02:54,110 --> 01:02:56,180
outin beta and it just got better and 

1101
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:58,040
better over time and customers send us 

1102
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,870
photos they love thisso we challenged 

1103
01:02:59,870 --> 01:03:02,240
the engineering team todo that again to 

1104
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:03,470
makeit easy for all of us to take 

1105
01:03:03,470 --> 01:03:05,329
 advantage of an advanced photographic 

1106
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:08,119
techniqueand they're doing it and it 

1107
01:03:08,119 --> 01:03:10,279
hasto do with lighting and if you've 

1108
01:03:10,279 --> 01:03:13,009
everhad a professional portrait taken 

1109
01:03:13,009 --> 01:03:14,779
you know thatPro photographers use 

1110
01:03:14,779 --> 01:03:16,519
advanced equipment and have a great

1111
01:03:16,519 --> 01:03:18,589
 understanding advanced techniques to 

1112
01:03:18,589 --> 01:03:21,140
literally sculpt the light on yourface 

1113
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:23,029
 to create the perfect mood for a 

1114
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:25,579
portrait photographwell our team is 

1115
01:03:25,579 --> 01:03:29,509
makingthis possible for all of us using 

1116
01:03:29,509 --> 01:03:31,430
the new dual camerasand the a 11 Bionic 

1117
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:34,459
chip and the iPhone 8 plusthe team has 

1118
01:03:34,459 --> 01:03:35,809
come up with a new feature called 

1119
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:38,930
portrait lightingthis is beta but it 

1120
01:03:38,930 --> 01:03:40,519
 will ship with the iPhone 8 plus and 

1121
01:03:40,519 --> 01:03:42,920
here's how it workswhen you compose a 

1122
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,019
photoin the camera app using the 

1123
01:03:45,019 --> 01:03:47,509
portrait mode the dual cameras in the

1124
01:03:47,509 --> 01:03:50,479
 isp sense the scene they create a depth 

1125
01:03:50,479 --> 01:03:52,579
map they separate the subject from the 

1126
01:03:52,579 --> 01:03:55,910
backgroundand then you see machine 

1127
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:58,459
 learning it creates facial landmarks and 

1128
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,289
actually changes the lightingof the 

1129
01:04:00,289 --> 01:04:02,690
contours over your face thathappens 

1130
01:04:02,690 --> 01:04:05,829
while you'recomposing the shot 

1131
01:04:11,240 --> 01:04:13,400
it's super easyto use right when you're 

1132
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,140
 in the camera app you use portrait mode 

1133
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,660
 and there's a new menu to select the 

1134
01:04:17,660 --> 01:04:19,640
lighting effect you wantto use you just 

1135
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:21,829
swipeto pick a different effect for 

1136
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:23,930
whateveryou want to shoot now these 

1137
01:04:23,930 --> 01:04:26,089
aren't filtersthis is real-time 

1138
01:04:26,089 --> 01:04:28,309
 analysis of the light on your subjects 

1139
01:04:28,309 --> 01:04:30,829
face in fact you can go in later after 

1140
01:04:30,829 --> 01:04:32,300
shot a portrait mode photo into the

1141
01:04:32,300 --> 01:04:34,250
 Photos app and change the lighting 

1142
01:04:34,250 --> 01:04:36,050
effect to select whichone you want to 

1143
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:38,859
useon your photograph 

1144
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,420
the team has done an unbelievable job on

1145
01:04:46,420 --> 01:04:47,890
thisand so here's an example of a photo 

1146
01:04:47,890 --> 01:04:49,870
that's takennot touched in any way 

1147
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:52,150
this is portrait mode using portrait

1148
01:04:52,150 --> 01:04:54,700
lightingit's actually using the setting 

1149
01:04:54,700 --> 01:04:56,380
in portrait lighting for stage light so 

1150
01:04:56,380 --> 01:04:57,730
it drops awaythe background to make 

1151
01:04:57,730 --> 01:04:59,920
 this stunning dramatic photograph it's 

1152
01:04:59,920 --> 01:05:00,910
absolutely beautiful

1153
01:05:00,910 --> 01:05:02,710
so iPhone 8 and 8 plus are incredible

1154
01:05:02,710 --> 01:05:04,810
 for taking pictures they're also amazing 

1155
01:05:04,810 --> 01:05:08,770
for video as wellin fact iPhone 8 has 

1156
01:05:08,770 --> 01:05:11,140
the highest qualityvideo capture ever 

1157
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:19,360
 in a smartphone along with the isp we 

1158
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,760
have an appledesign video encoder this 

1159
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:23,890
enables faster frame rates and higher

1160
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:26,980
qualityvideo it does real-time image 

1161
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:29,680
and motionanalysis to predict changes 

1162
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:32,050
in the contentand optimize the video 

1163
01:05:32,050 --> 01:05:34,810
 encoding algorithms so while you're 

1164
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,820
shootingvideo let's say for K 60 frames 

1165
01:05:36,820 --> 01:05:39,610
a secondthe iPhone 8 divides each frame 

1166
01:05:39,610 --> 01:05:43,090
into individual tilestwo million of 

1167
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,800
themand we analyze the two million 

1168
01:05:44,800 --> 01:05:47,170
 tiles every second looking for details 

1169
01:05:47,170 --> 01:05:49,480
 like texture and edges to predict 

1170
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:52,900
whetherthat tile has grass sky water or 

1171
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:55,870
movement init so let's say you're 

1172
01:05:55,870 --> 01:05:58,180
shooting 4k60 frame rate video you can 

1173
01:05:58,180 --> 01:05:59,530
 look like this it's beautifully 

1174
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:02,410
optimized for qualityand for 

1175
01:06:02,410 --> 01:06:04,120
compressionlevel and this video was 

1176
01:06:04,120 --> 01:06:09,390
shot on an iPhone in 4k it's amazing and 

1177
01:06:09,390 --> 01:06:11,860
if you're oneof the many people who 

1178
01:06:11,860 --> 01:06:13,930
love shooting slow-mo videos that's 

1179
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,400
 gotten a lot better too now you can 

1180
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,070
shoot a 1080p HD 240 frames a second 

1181
01:06:20,070 --> 01:06:23,910
 that's double the frame rate of previous 

1182
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:26,620
absolutely beautiful so nowiPhone 8 is 

1183
01:06:26,620 --> 01:06:28,420
incrediblefor shooting photos it's 

1184
01:06:28,420 --> 01:06:29,710
incredible for video there's a third

1185
01:06:29,710 --> 01:06:32,260
categoryof use of the camera that's 

1186
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:33,820
gonna become increasingly important in

1187
01:06:33,820 --> 01:06:37,000
 our mobile devices and that's augmented 

1188
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,690
realitythis is an incredible area for 

1189
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,820
usto advance in in our teams have 

1190
01:06:42,820 --> 01:06:45,490
worked together hardware and softwareto 

1191
01:06:45,490 --> 01:06:47,830
makeiPhone le the first camera the 

1192
01:06:47,830 --> 01:06:49,450
 first iPhone really created for 

1193
01:06:49,450 --> 01:06:50,680
augmented realityin the first 

1194
01:06:50,680 --> 01:06:54,160
smartphone designed for it as wellwe 

1195
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:56,800
custom tune each iPhone for augmented

1196
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:57,880
reality

1197
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,319
the cameras are actuallyindividually 

1198
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:01,150
calibrated in the factory andthat makes 

1199
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:03,009
a hugedifference in the performance for 

1200
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:05,380
AR there are new gyroscopes new 

1201
01:07:05,380 --> 01:07:07,989
accelerometers anda are kits software 

1202
01:07:07,989 --> 01:07:10,660
is tightly tuned toall this hardware to 

1203
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:12,579
deliver the best experiencefrom motion 

1204
01:07:12,579 --> 01:07:15,789
 tracking an AR greatly benefits in the 

1205
01:07:15,789 --> 01:07:18,699
newa 11 Bionic chip the CPU handles 

1206
01:07:18,699 --> 01:07:21,819
world trackingthe new apple GPU renders 

1207

 amorphous immersive graphics at up to 60 

1208
01:07:23,589 --> 01:07:27,219
frames a second the new ISP does 

1209
01:07:27,219 --> 01:07:29,650
real-time lighting estimation andthis 

1210
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:32,380
stuff is amazing that it happens on a

1211
01:07:32,380 --> 01:07:34,479
device in the palmof our hands so I 

1212
01:07:34,479 --> 01:07:35,650
want to show you some ofthe work that 

1213
01:07:35,650 --> 01:07:37,150
developers arestarting to do with AR 

1214
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:40,180
apps oniPhone 8 so here's one example 

1215
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:42,999
 it's a game Warhammer 40k free blade 

1216
01:07:42,999 --> 01:07:45,640
 from pixel toys you can now use their 

1217
01:07:45,640 --> 01:07:47,650
photo mode to bring the free bladenight 

1218
01:07:47,650 --> 01:07:50,589
into the real worldand play it right 

1219
01:07:50,589 --> 01:07:51,819
where your friends arestanding around 

1220
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:55,900
you here's anotherfrom Major League 

1221

Baseball'sadvanced media team they're 

1222
01:07:57,670 --> 01:08:00,219
enhancing theat bat app with AR kit so 

1223
01:08:00,219 --> 01:08:01,359
that when you're at the game you can 

1224
01:08:01,359 --> 01:08:02,949
holdup your iPhone and see real-time 

1225
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:05,829
player information and stats on top of

1226
01:08:05,829 --> 01:08:10,089
the game you're watching andhere's sky 

1227
01:08:10,089 --> 01:08:12,519
guidefrom v STAR Labs you can use AR 

1228
01:08:12,519 --> 01:08:14,289
kit with this app toactually 

1229
01:08:14,289 --> 01:08:17,198
superimpose the map ontop of the sky as 

1230
01:08:17,198 --> 01:08:19,060
you're looking at itaround you this 

1231
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:21,009

1251
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,439
table in the same roommy friend and 

1252
01:09:24,439 --> 01:09:26,060
co-founder Andrea is preparing a match 

1253
01:09:26,060 --> 01:09:30,679
for uswhere we play the rebels against 

1254
01:09:30,679 --> 01:09:33,849
the dominators

1255
01:09:36,988 --> 01:09:39,839
what's reallycool is with a or kit the 

1256
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:41,670
metaltwo on the new iPhone we are able 

1257
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:44,130
to experience gamesin an entirely new 

1258
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:47,160
 way these players are able to view the 

1259
01:09:47,160 --> 01:09:49,799
 game from any angle our content has to 

1260
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:52,738
be incredibly detailed with the power of 

1261
01:09:52,738 --> 01:09:55,320
the newiPhone an unreal support for 

1262
01:09:55,320 --> 01:09:57,600
metal2 we are able to render the entire 

1263
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:01,410
 level on screen and amazing 1.2 million 

1264
01:10:01,410 --> 01:10:04,710
polygons while also allowing youto move 

1265
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:07,620
in close to really appreciate thehigh 

1266
01:10:07,620 --> 01:10:10,980
 visual fidelity and just look at those 

1267
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,550
4k texturesit's gorgeous 

1268
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:18,560
now shall we go into thegame 

1269
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:26,040
AR allows us to use our position in the 

1270
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:27,620
real worldto gain a tactical advantage 

1271
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,790
 just look how antha is moving towards 

1272
01:10:29,790 --> 01:10:32,219
 this cave lining up his targets this is 

1273
01:10:32,219 --> 01:10:33,090
somethingthat would have been hard to 

1274
01:10:33,090 --> 01:10:39,270
do with tension- it's like you're not 

1275
01:10:39,270 --> 01:10:42,239
just controlling the game you're in the 

1276
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:45,989
game another awesome additionto the 

1277
01:10:45,989 --> 01:10:48,600
experience is spatial audio if you go

1278
01:10:48,600 --> 01:10:52,430
 close to the action the sound increases 

1279
01:10:54,730 --> 01:10:57,949
and if a solidobject gets between you 

1280
01:10:57,949 --> 01:11:00,050
 and the action the sound is occluded 

1281
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:02,180
perfectnow with the stereo speakers on 

1282
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:06,410
 the new iPhone this is truly amazing it 

1283
01:11:06,410 --> 01:11:09,550
looks like we're gettinghit pretty hard 

1284
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:12,739
yes deployshield to protect our heroes 

1285
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:15,320

1289

at the sametime 

1290
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:39,250
what you just saw is an amazing

1291
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,840
evolution in how games areplayed and 

1292
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,820

1293
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,590

1295
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:48,310
 look for the machines on the App Store

this month exclusively on iOS

1297
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:02,539
Thank YouAli now let's talk about 

1298
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:09,110
Wireless we once said that the future is 

1299
01:12:09,110 --> 01:12:12,289
 Wireless and boy will be right that's 

1300
01:12:12,289 --> 01:12:15,679
becoming more true than ever beforewith 

1301
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,130
 iPhone 8 it supports LTE advanced for 

1302
01:12:19,130 --> 01:12:21,489
fast networking connectionsBluetooth 

1303
01:12:21,489 --> 01:12:23,750
5.0 for thelatest accessories 

1304
01:12:23,750 --> 01:12:25,730
of course it supportsour great beloved 

1305
01:12:25,730 --> 01:12:28,520
air pods and the beats X headphones that 

1306
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,340
use ourw1 chip and the new Beats Studio 

1307
01:12:31,340 --> 01:12:34,849
 threes as well and now with iPhone 8 

1308
01:12:34,849 --> 01:12:38,000
 with its glass back we're enabling the 

1309
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:46,670
freedom ofwireless charging I mean this 

1310
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:49,039
is a simple thingwe do this every day 

1311
01:12:49,039 --> 01:12:50,630
we useour phones in the day and we 

1312
01:12:50,630 --> 01:12:53,119
 charge them at night often on a charger 

1313
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:55,340
by our bed stand inour homes or in our 

1314
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:58,190
hotels and words can't describe justhow 

1315
01:12:58,190 --> 01:12:59,989
much nicer it is to just put it down and 

1316
01:12:59,989 --> 01:13:01,550
pick it up whenever you want to charge 

1317
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:03,739
withoutever having to plug in a cable 

1318
01:13:03,739 --> 01:13:06,349
againyou can want to do this by your 

1319
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:08,539
bedsideI don't want to do this in a 

1320
01:13:08,539 --> 01:13:10,250
cafe orrestaurant as they start to 

1321
01:13:10,250 --> 01:13:13,489
support wireless charging I want to do 

1322
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:15,170
it in an airport so youcan top up your 

1323
01:13:15,170 --> 01:13:16,690
chargebefore you get on the next flight 

1324
01:13:16,690 --> 01:13:19,760
and perhaps the best use case of all in 

1325
01:13:19,760 --> 01:13:21,050
your car

1326
01:13:21,050 --> 01:13:22,849
youcan get into your car wirelessly 

1327
01:13:22,849 --> 01:13:26,239
connect and start usingcarplay put your 

1328
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:28,280
iPhoneon the center console and it's 

1329
01:13:28,280 --> 01:13:29,929
chargingall without ever having to plug 

1330
01:13:29,929 --> 01:13:32,659
in a cableagain what makes this 

1331
01:13:32,659 --> 01:13:34,670
possibleis we're building into iPhone 8 

1332
01:13:34,670 --> 01:13:37,849
and 8 plus wireless charging withQi 

1333
01:13:37,849 --> 01:13:39,650
 that she is the leading openness 

1334
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:42,199
wireless charging standardand we hope 

1335
01:13:42,199 --> 01:13:44,989
to help Qi by increasing adoption of it 

1336
01:13:44,989 --> 01:13:49,940
in creating newuse cases for it many 

1337
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:53,239
 restaurants shops airports cars have 

1338
01:13:53,239 --> 01:13:54,920
started to build in support for Qi

1339
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:57,289
wireless chargingand they'll work with 

1340
01:13:57,289 --> 01:14:01,099
 iPhone a many companies are offering qi 

1341
01:14:01,099 --> 01:14:03,139
chargers and thosethat are chief 

1342
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,300
certified should allwork with iphone 8 

1343
01:14:05,300 --> 01:14:08,090
and we'veworked with some developers 

1344
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,889

1345
01:14:09,889 --> 01:14:11,150

01:19:11,310 --> 01:19:16,370
it's called the super Retina display

1427
01:19:19,140 --> 01:19:21,390
the love of quality and responsiveness

1428
01:19:21,390 --> 01:19:23,640
 and efficiency is really quite a 

1429
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,210
breakthrough in mobile displaysto start 

1430
01:19:27,210 --> 01:19:29,820
with the super RetinaDisplay is 5.8 

1431
01:19:29,820 --> 01:19:32,090
inches on the diagonal

1432
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:37,110
it's got 24 36 by1125 resolution that's 

1433
01:19:37,110 --> 01:19:42,750
 over 2.7 million pixels it is 458 pixels 

1434
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:43,980
per inch now this is thehighest 

1435
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:47,100
resolution and pixel density ever in an 

1436
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:51,090
iPhone and it's remarkablehow this 

1437
01:19:51,090 --> 01:19:53,340
larger display canbe packed on a phone 

1438
01:19:53,340 --> 01:19:56,000
that fits so comfortably in our hands 

1439
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:58,800
the super Retina display uses OLED

1440
01:19:58,800 --> 01:20:01,200
technologythis is the first OLED 

1441
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:04,430
displaygreat enough to be in an iPhone 

1442
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:07,140
traditionalOLED displays have had great 

1443
01:20:07,140 --> 01:20:09,390
benefits like high contrastand 

1444
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:11,790
resolutionand no backlight means it can 

1445
01:20:11,790 --> 01:20:13,980
make them thinner butthey came with 

1446
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,260
trade-offsand brightness and rich 

1447
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:18,270
colors and color accuracyat least 

1448
01:20:18,270 --> 01:20:20,910
comparedto our Retina displays but the 

1449
01:20:20,910 --> 01:20:22,950
superRetina display overcomes all of 

1450
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:24,780
thesedeficiencies and lives up to all 

1451
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:29,400
that we expect from an iPhone display in 

1452
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,950
addition the new superRetina display 

1453
01:20:30,950 --> 01:20:33,540
supports HDR in both the Dolbyvision 

1454
01:20:33,540 --> 01:20:37,140
and HDR 10 formats it has an incredible

1455
01:20:37,140 --> 01:20:40,170
 a million to 1 contrast ratio that is 

1456
01:20:40,170 --> 01:20:42,780
 the best color accuracy it integrates 

1457
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,120
our unique 3d touch technology right

1458
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:47,370
into the displayand like iPhone 8 

1459
01:20:47,370 --> 01:20:52,080
includes true tone now all this

1460
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:53,790
innovative super Retinadisplay 

1461
01:20:53,790 --> 01:20:56,010
technology is great but it's thepoint 

1462
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:58,440
of it thatmatters and the point of it 

1463
01:20:58,440 --> 01:21:01,080
is to enable an entirely new experience 

1464
01:21:01,080 --> 01:21:04,980
that's more fluid moreintuitive so 

1465
01:21:04,980 --> 01:21:07,140
let's startwith a simplest thing how do 

1466
01:21:07,140 --> 01:21:09,060
you wake upyour iPhone 10 well 

1467
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,740
certainly you can raise to wake just

1468
01:21:10,740 --> 01:21:13,770
likebefore but now you can also just 

1469
01:21:13,770 --> 01:21:19,230
tap onthe screen and it wakes up now 

1470
01:21:19,230 --> 01:21:20,700
with the display going edge to edge and

1471
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,400
 top to bottom bottom there's no more 

1472
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,830
home button nowthis is an important 

1473
01:21:25,830 --> 01:21:27,690
partand a big step forward in the 

1474
01:21:27,690 --> 01:21:31,320
iPhone user experience somethingwe use 

1475
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,870
hundreds of times a dayfor so 

1476
01:21:32,870 --> 01:21:35,750
any tasks is anopportunity to rethink 

1477
01:21:35,750 --> 01:21:38,390
 how iPhone should work and how we can 

1478
01:21:38,390 --> 01:21:41,720
 make it better so now when you want to 

1479
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:44,750
 go to the home screen you simply swipe 

1480
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:47,990
up from thebottom and you go home it's 

1481
01:21:47,990 --> 01:21:49,970
that simpleit's that easy it's 

1482
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:51,860
incredibly smooth and once you do it for

1483
01:21:51,860 --> 01:21:53,600
the first timeyou'll know there's never 

1484
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:56,480
been a betterway and it works the same 

1485
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,240
 way across the system you're running an 

1486
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:00,980
app likemail and you want to go home 

1487
01:22:00,980 --> 01:22:03,350
 what do you do you simply swipe up from 

1488
01:22:03,350 --> 01:22:06,020
 the bottom and you go home it's that 

1489
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:08,780
easyand that intuitive it's so much 

1490
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:12,140
nicer now the same fluid gesture also 

1491
01:22:12,140 --> 01:22:14,720
works for multitaskingso if you're in 

1492
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:17,360
an app and youwant a multitask you just 

1493
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,070
swipe upfrom the bottom you pause for 

1494
01:22:19,070 --> 01:22:20,780
split secondand you're in multitasking 

1495
01:22:20,780 --> 01:22:23,510
and then you can tap on any app and jump 

1496
01:22:23,510 --> 01:22:27,080
right toit we also use the home button 

1497
01:22:27,080 --> 01:22:29,060
for Siri so how are we going to do that 

1498
01:22:29,060 --> 01:22:31,220
 now well of course you can just speak to 

1499
01:22:31,220 --> 01:22:33,550
 your phone as before and say hey Siri 

1500
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:37,030
now I didn'tstudy once phones off or 

1501
01:22:37,030 --> 01:22:40,190
youcan now press the side button in 

1502
01:22:40,190 --> 01:22:42,200
which has been made larger once you

1503
01:22:42,200 --> 01:22:45,730
press it in you canjust talk to Siri I 

1504
01:22:45,730 --> 01:22:47,570
know what you're thinkingabout well 

1505
01:22:47,570 --> 01:22:50,210
whatabout unlocking how do you unlock 

1506
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:52,670
yourphone with iPhone 10 I mean this 

1507
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:54,260
hasbeen very important part of the 

1508
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:56,450
iPhone user experiencefrom the very 

1509
01:22:56,450 --> 01:23:00,350
beginning thefirst iPhone we led the 

1510
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,730
waywith multi-touch and we created 

1511
01:23:01,730 --> 01:23:03,980
slide to unlock andthis protected the 

1512
01:23:03,980 --> 01:23:05,660
iPhone from turningon when you didn't 

1513
01:23:05,660 --> 01:23:07,810
 want it to like in your pocket 

1514
01:23:07,810 --> 01:23:11,060
starting with iPhone 5s we invented

1515
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:14,030
touch IDmade it fast and easy to 

1516
01:23:14,030 --> 01:23:15,650
protect allyour data and unlock your 

1517
01:23:15,650 --> 01:23:17,840
 phone with just your fingerprint and 

1518
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:20,510
touch ID became the gold standardin 

1519
01:23:20,510 --> 01:23:23,990
consumer device biometric protection but

1520
01:23:23,990 --> 01:23:25,160
 we know we can do something that's 

1521
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:29,510
better the iPhone 10 your iPhone is

1522
01:23:29,510 --> 01:23:32,240
lockeduntil you look at it and it 

1523
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:34,760
recognizes you nothing hasever been 

1524
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:38,210
simplermore natural and effortless we 

1525
01:23:38,210 --> 01:23:42,490
call thisface ID 

1526
01:23:46,310 --> 01:23:50,670
so face ID is the future ofhow we will 

1527
01:23:50,670 --> 01:23:52,500
unlockour smartphones and protect our 

1528
01:23:52,500 --> 01:23:56,280
sensitive informationto make face ID 

1529
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:57,360
possible it took some ofthe most 

1530
01:23:57,360 --> 01:23:59,070
advanced technology we haveever created 

1531
01:23:59,070 --> 01:24:01,469
and much of it is packed right up here 

1532
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,480
into this tiny little area at the top of 

1533
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,390
thedisplay we call this the true depth 

1534
01:24:06,390 --> 01:24:10,350
camera systemand it is made up of 

1535
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:12,300
incredible state-of-the-art technology

1536
01:24:12,300 --> 01:24:15,030
there's an infrared cameraa flood 

1537
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:17,670
illuminatorthe front side camera and a 

1538
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:20,670
dot projector and that's not allthere's 

1539
01:24:20,670 --> 01:24:22,560
also theproximity sensor the ambient 

1540
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:23,880
light sensor the speakerand microphone 

1541
01:24:23,880 --> 01:24:26,100
 all packed into this true depth camera 

1542
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:29,940
systemarea it is amazing and here's how 

1543
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,250
it worksevery time you glance at your 

1544
01:24:32,250 --> 01:24:34,770
iPhone 10 it detects your face with the 

1545
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:37,640
flooda new illuminator even in the dark 

1546
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:42,630
 the IR camera takes an IR image the dot 

1547
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:44,969
projector projects out over 30,000

1548
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:52,890
invisible IR dots we use the IRimage in 

1549
01:24:52,890 --> 01:24:54,270
the dotpattern and we push them through 

1550
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:57,210
neuralnetworks to create a mathematical 

1551
01:24:57,210 --> 01:24:59,700
modelof your face and then we check 

1552
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:01,530
that mathematical model against the one 

1553
01:25:01,530 --> 01:25:02,700
that we've stored thatyou set up 

1554
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:05,190
earlier to see if to match and unlock 

1555
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,960
your phone and this all happens in real 

1556
01:25:06,960 --> 01:25:08,489
time it all happens invisibly you don't

1557
01:25:08,489 --> 01:25:10,170
see these thingsgoing off it's 

1558
01:25:10,170 --> 01:25:12,239
incredibleit just all works it all 

1559
01:25:12,239 --> 01:25:15,360
happens to create face IDwe work with 

1560
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,370
 thousands of people around the world and 

1561
01:25:17,370 --> 01:25:20,480
the teamtook over a billion images and 

1562
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:23,280
with that they developed multiple neural

1563
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,160
networksto create face ID and to 

1564
01:25:26,160 --> 01:25:28,410
 process the machine learning in face 

1565
01:25:28,410 --> 01:25:30,420
 side these neural networks we built 

1566
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:31,620
 Apple's first-ever 

1567
01:25:31,620 --> 01:25:36,150
neural engine yeahthis is a big deal in 

1568
01:25:36,150 --> 01:25:39,000
our pocketsin our phones is an A 11 

1569
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:40,590
Bionic chip with abuilt in neural 

1570
01:25:40,590 --> 01:25:44,570
engine to process face recognition

1571
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:51,690
now theneuro engine is specialized 

1572
01:25:51,690 --> 01:25:53,610
Hardware built for a specific set of 

1573
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:56,460
machine learningalgorithms this is 

1574
01:25:56,460 --> 01:25:57,719
another exampleof the incredible 

1575
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,579
 collaboration between the hardware and 

1576
01:25:59,579 --> 01:26:01,829
software teamsit's only possible at 

1577
01:26:01,829 --> 01:26:04,639
Applethe neural engine is a 

1578
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:07,380
state-of-the-art ultra-fast processing 

1579
01:26:07,380 --> 01:26:09,030
system it usesour highest density 

1580
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:11,280
computing everit's a dual core design 

1581
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:13,079
itcan perform over 600 billion 

1582
01:26:13,079 --> 01:26:16,170
operations per secondand it's used to 

1583
01:26:16,170 --> 01:26:18,079
thereal-time processing of face ID 

1584
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:21,059
 recognition but for all of us us it's 

1585
01:26:21,059 --> 01:26:23,449
just supereasy and fun to use 

1586
01:26:23,449 --> 01:26:26,460
 when you setup face ID you just follow 

1587
01:26:26,460 --> 01:26:28,559
theon-screen instructions and it tells 

1588
01:26:28,559 --> 01:26:29,880
youhow to move your head around in the 

1589
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,219
camera soFez site D can recognize your 

1590
01:26:32,219 --> 01:26:34,320
faceand that's it you do that once when 

1591
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,679
youset it up and face ID learns your 

1592
01:26:37,679 --> 01:26:41,929
faceeven if you change your hairstyle 

1593
01:26:41,929 --> 01:26:45,719
 you decide to put on glasses you're 

1594
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:47,670
wearinga hat so you do it up any way 

1595
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,999
you do itface ID learns your face it 

1596
01:26:50,999 --> 01:26:54,599
learns who you are and itadapts to you 

1597
01:26:54,599 --> 01:26:56,849
as your face changesover time let's say 

1598
01:26:56,849 --> 01:26:59,070
you start to growa beard it works in 

1599
01:26:59,070 --> 01:27:03,059
day itworks at night and the team's 

1600
01:27:03,059 --> 01:27:06,360
 work hard to make sure the face ID can 

1601
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:07,769
easily be spoofedby things like 

1602
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:12,300
photographs he even gone and worked with 

1603
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,249
professional mask makers and makeup

1604
01:27:14,249 --> 01:27:16,829
artists in Hollywood to protect against

1605
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:18,749
these attempts to beat face IDthese are 

1606
01:27:18,749 --> 01:27:20,789
actualmasks used by the engineering 

1607
01:27:20,789 --> 01:27:22,949
 team to train the neural networks to 

1608
01:27:22,949 --> 01:27:25,739
protect against themand face ID it's 

1609
01:27:25,739 --> 01:27:26,550
incredible

1610
01:27:26,550 --> 01:27:28,530
theteam's worked hard to protect your 

1611
01:27:28,530 --> 01:27:31,699
face datayes 

1612
01:27:36,770 --> 01:27:39,140
your facestate is protected with the 

1613
01:27:39,140 --> 01:27:41,060
secure Enclaveand the AL Evan Bionic 

1614
01:27:41,060 --> 01:27:43,580
chipall the processing is done on 

1615
01:27:43,580 --> 01:27:47,030
iPhone 10 and not sent to a server we 

1616
01:27:47,030 --> 01:27:49,400
require user attentionto unlock that 

1617
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:51,080
means if your eyesare closed you're 

1618
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:53,890
looking awayit's not going to unlock 

1619
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:56,660
nowhow do we compare that to touch ID 

1620
01:27:56,660 --> 01:27:59,870
how secure is it well there's no perfect 

1621
01:27:59,870 --> 01:28:01,880
 system not even biometric ones but as we 

1622
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:03,590
 said earlier touch ID is the gold 

1623
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:05,570
standard for consumer device biometric 

1624
01:28:05,570 --> 01:28:08,480
protectionand the data for touch ID has 

1625
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:11,720
beenone in 50,000 meaning that the 

1626
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,730
chance thata random person could use 

1627
01:28:13,730 --> 01:28:15,770
their fingerprint to unlock youriPhone 

1628
01:28:15,770 --> 01:28:18,410
hasbeen about 1 in 50,000 and it's been 

1629
01:28:18,410 --> 01:28:20,650
greatso what are the similar statistics 

1630
01:28:20,650 --> 01:28:27,610
 for face ID one in a million 

1631
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:35,570
the chance thata random person in the 

1632
01:28:35,570 --> 01:28:37,670
populationcould look at your iPhone 10 

1633
01:28:37,670 --> 01:28:39,800
and unlockit with their face is about 

1634
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,739
one in a millionand of course the 

1635
01:28:42,739 --> 01:28:44,570
statistics are lower if that person

1636
01:28:44,570 --> 01:28:46,730
shares a close genetic relationship with

1637
01:28:46,730 --> 01:28:49,039
youso for example if you happen to have 

1638
01:28:49,039 --> 01:28:52,969
an evil twinyou really need to protect 

1639
01:28:52,969 --> 01:28:54,710
your passcodewhere your sensitive data 

1640
01:28:54,710 --> 01:28:58,340
 with a passcode hopefully you don't face 

1641
01:28:58,340 --> 01:29:01,730
IDalso works with Apple pay so to pay 

1642
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:03,440
for things youjust double tap the 

1643
01:29:03,440 --> 01:29:05,840
button on the sideyou look at iPhone 10 

1644
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:07,639
to authenticateand hold it near the 

1645
01:29:07,639 --> 01:29:09,559
payment terminal to payit's that easy 

1646
01:29:09,559 --> 01:29:13,610
 fast intuitive simple based ID also 

1647
01:29:13,610 --> 01:29:15,710
 works with third party apps third party 

1648
01:29:15,710 --> 01:29:17,539
appsalready support touch ID and 

1649
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:19,520
they'll work with face ID so apps like

1650
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:22,969
mintone password etrade will all work 

1651
01:29:22,969 --> 01:29:27,739
with face ID so face IDit's faith on 

1652
01:29:27,739 --> 01:29:30,079
face authentication forunlocking your 

1653
01:29:30,079 --> 01:29:31,610
 iPhone and protecting your sensitive 

1654
01:29:31,610 --> 01:29:34,070
 data they used the innovative to depth 

1655
01:29:34,070 --> 01:29:37,039
camera systemit's trained with neural 

1656
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,949
networksit's easy to set up it learns 

1657
01:29:39,949 --> 01:29:41,929
yourface and it adapts to your face 

1658
01:29:41,929 --> 01:29:45,380
over time it's aware of your attention

1659
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:48,079
it works with Apple payand it works 

1660
01:29:48,079 --> 01:29:51,230
 with third-party apps this tree def 

1661
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:52,909
camera system is incredible

1662
01:29:52,909 --> 01:29:54,710
technology and it's goingto enable so 

1663
01:29:54,710 --> 01:29:57,079
many great new user experiencesthe 

1664
01:29:57,079 --> 01:30:00,110
first one of courseis face ID but the 

1665
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:01,400
teamdecided to create another great 

1666
01:30:01,400 --> 01:30:03,650
experiencewith it as well this is a fun 

1667
01:30:03,650 --> 01:30:06,559
one it has to do with emojis that we use 

1668
01:30:06,559 --> 01:30:08,449
emojis to communicate with others and to

1669
01:30:08,449 --> 01:30:10,099
express emotion but of course you can't

1670
01:30:10,099 --> 01:30:12,139
customize emojis they only have a

1671
01:30:12,139 --> 01:30:13,940
limitedamount of expressiveness to them 

1672
01:30:13,940 --> 01:30:17,809
 so our team created something called an 

1673
01:30:17,809 --> 01:30:22,119
emojithese are animated emojis 

1674
01:30:22,719 --> 01:30:25,249
these are emojis thatyou control with 

1675
01:30:25,249 --> 01:30:31,219
your face in emojis track more than 50 

1676
01:30:31,219 --> 01:30:33,050
facial muscle movements

1677
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,510
they've been meticulously animated to

1678
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:41,119
create amazing expressiveness you just

1679
01:30:41,119 --> 01:30:44,479
watch this can you the way youcreate 

1680
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:46,489
and share an emojiare right from within 

1681
01:30:46,489 --> 01:30:53,210
 Apple messages you said literally where 

1682
01:30:53,210 --> 01:30:57,170
are you you canpick from a dozen 

1683
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:59,840

01:35:33,030 --> 01:35:34,770
now of coursemany of us like to 

1775
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:37,800
communicate with emojiand with an emoji 

1776
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:40,260
we can now breathe our own personality

1777
01:35:40,260 --> 01:35:42,690
 into our favourites it's available as an 

1778
01:35:42,690 --> 01:35:45,030
app right inside a messages I canjust 

1779
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:46,710
go rightin here and it immediately 

1780
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,810
starts tracking me so I can make 

1781
01:35:48,810 --> 01:35:52,110
whatever expression I want like and just 

1782
01:35:52,110 --> 01:35:53,610
pick that up and use it as a sticker

1783
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:56,730
 drop it on my message like that we also 

1784
01:35:56,730 --> 01:35:58,320
let you manipulate these infull-screen 

1785
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:00,510
 you can audition your favorites there's 

1786

catis so expressive and ferocious it's 

1788
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:09,510
a happypuppy check out the physics in 

1789
01:36:09,510 --> 01:36:19,010
the earsthe pig we've got a chicken and 

1790

and yes if you were by chance wondering

1793
01:36:35,380 --> 01:36:37,630
what humanitywould do when given access 

1794
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,060
tothe most advanced facial tracking 

1795
01:36:40,060 --> 01:36:42,580
technology availableyou now have your 

1796
01:36:42,580 --> 01:36:48,220
answer now these can beso much fun 

1797
01:36:48,220 --> 01:36:49,150
you'regonna want to share them 

1798
01:36:49,150 --> 01:36:51,130
unfortunately we let you record messages 

1799
01:36:51,130 --> 01:36:53,550
I'm gonna record a message here for Tim 

1800
01:36:53,550 --> 01:36:56,830
heyTim I'm not sure what the protocol 

1801
01:36:56,830 --> 01:36:59,020
 is here but I'd like to call dibs on the 

1802
01:36:59,020 --> 01:37:02,020
 box for my favorite emoji which one do 

1803
01:37:02,020 --> 01:37:06,070
you like hey Tim I'm not sure what the 

1804
01:37:06,070 --> 01:37:08,050
protocol ishere but I'd like to call 

1805
01:37:08,050 --> 01:37:10,720
dibs on thebox for my favorite emoji 

1806

 which one do you like now you can send 

1807
01:37:13,930 --> 01:37:16,150
it with just a tap andit appears 

1808
01:37:16,150 --> 01:37:18,460
there's a looping videoright inside the 

1809
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,890
transcriptwe're really lucky for our 

1810
01:37:20,890 --> 01:37:22,300
grandfinale we might just get a 

1811
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:26,110
response backfrom Tim oh here it is 

1812
01:37:26,110 --> 01:37:30,610
let's let'stake a look take me to your 

1813
01:37:30,610 --> 01:37:31,920
leader

1814
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,800
wait a minute Craig I am your leader

1815
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:38,490
 let's wrap this thing up 

1816
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:52,850
so that is your first look atthe new 

1817
01:37:52,850 --> 01:37:55,370
iPhone10 and the amazing experience 

1818
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,230
withthe true depth camera and an emoji 

1819
01:37:57,230 --> 01:37:59,300
I think you're gonna love it thank you 

1820
01:37:59,300 --> 01:38:01,660
very much 

1821
01:38:04,150 --> 01:38:08,690
ThankYou Craig now let's talk about the 

1822
01:38:08,690 --> 01:38:12,950
amazing cameras iniphone 10 iphone 10 

1823
01:38:12,950 --> 01:38:16,820
has dual 12 megapixel sensorsdual 

1824
01:38:16,820 --> 01:38:19,190
cameras both a faster sensors wider

1825
01:38:19,190 --> 01:38:21,590
sensorsjust like in iphone 8 as new 

1826
01:38:21,590 --> 01:38:24,290
color filters new deeper pixelsthere's 

1827
01:38:24,290 --> 01:38:26,120
an F 1.8 aperture onthe wide-angle 

1828
01:38:26,120 --> 01:38:29,720
camera and a faster F 2.4 aperture on a 

1829
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:32,330
telephoto so that lets in36 percent 

1830
01:38:32,330 --> 01:38:36,710
more light tothe telephoto camera but 

1831
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:38,420
the big newson the camera on the iPhone 

1832
01:38:38,420 --> 01:38:40,520
 10 is it as dual optical image 

1833
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,260
stabilization that meansthere's OIS 

1834
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:44,330
about thewide angle in the telephoto 

1835
01:38:44,330 --> 01:38:46,400
 lens that's a lot of magnets moving 

1836
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,900
around in a verysmall space but it 

1837
01:38:47,900 --> 01:38:50,210
helps with compensating forhandshake 

1838
01:38:50,210 --> 01:38:52,490
 and to take better photos and videos in 

1839
01:38:52,490 --> 01:38:56,240
low-light there's also a better quadled 

1840
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,340
two-tone flash thatis twice the 

1841
01:38:58,340 --> 01:39:01,220
uniformity oflight on our subjects so 

1842
01:39:01,220 --> 01:39:02,810
let's look at somephotos taken from the 

1843
01:39:02,810 --> 01:39:06,050
backside camera on iPhone 10 this is 

1844
01:39:06,050 --> 01:39:08,360
absolutely beautifulgreat dynamic range 

1845
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:12,580
 detail low noise is a beautiful photo 

1846
01:39:12,580 --> 01:39:15,910
 the textures are simply stunning 

1847
01:39:15,910 --> 01:39:18,350
now there's zero shutter lagand that 

1848
01:39:18,350 --> 01:39:19,910
helps tofreeze motion so we can get a 

1849
01:39:19,910 --> 01:39:22,340
 photo like this look at that blue sky 

1850
01:39:22,340 --> 01:39:24,470
with low noise it's absolutely to die 

1851
01:39:24,470 --> 01:39:25,870
for

1852
01:39:25,870 --> 01:39:28,460
the OIS delivers low-light performance

1853
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:30,860
so now you can get incredible low-light

1854
01:39:30,860 --> 01:39:32,270
images like this withthe telephoto 

1855
01:39:32,270 --> 01:39:35,690
camera as wellas the wide-angle an 

1856
01:39:35,690 --> 01:39:38,270
 iPhone 10 is fantastic for the portrait 

1857
01:39:38,270 --> 01:39:40,250
 mode feature that we all love My Phone 

1858
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:41,690
 10 you get great portrait modes 

1859
01:39:41,690 --> 01:39:44,300
especially in lower light an iPhone 10 

1860
01:39:44,300 --> 01:39:45,980
supports thebrand-new portrait lighting 

1861
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,220
 feature as well that's again a photo 

1862
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:50,930
taken rightoff of iPhone 10 not 

1863
01:39:50,930 --> 01:39:52,460
retouched in any way with a stage

1864
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:54,080
lightingeffect dropping out the 

1865
01:39:54,080 --> 01:39:56,500
 background 

1866
01:40:00,170 --> 01:40:03,090
iPhone 10 is great for photos it's 

1867
01:40:03,090 --> 01:40:06,659
amazing for 4kvideo and like iPhone 8 

1868
01:40:06,659 --> 01:40:09,659
 it's tuned for a our applications as 

1869
01:40:09,659 --> 01:40:11,969
factory calibrated cameras the new

1870
01:40:11,969 --> 01:40:15,150
gyroscope accelerometerthe performance 

1871
01:40:15,150 --> 01:40:17,670
advantage of the a 11 Bionic chipsCPU 

1872
01:40:17,670 --> 01:40:21,750
 GPU and ISP and I our kit is tuned for 

1873
01:40:21,750 --> 01:40:25,139
 iPhone 10 now the backside camera that 

1874
01:40:25,139 --> 01:40:26,880
we use somuch is not the only camera of 

1875
01:40:26,880 --> 01:40:29,040
courseon the iPhone we have our front 

1876
01:40:29,040 --> 01:40:30,630
side camera as well and people love to 

1877
01:40:30,630 --> 01:40:33,239
use those for taking selfie photographs 

1878
01:40:33,239 --> 01:40:35,760
and now with iPhone10 and it's true 

1879
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:37,739
depth camerait really delivers a 

1880
01:40:37,739 --> 01:40:39,810
breakthroughinto the photos you can 

1881
01:40:39,810 --> 01:40:42,179
takefor selfies because now with 

1882
01:40:42,179 --> 01:40:44,159
selfiesyou can take portrait mode 

1883
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:47,270
photos as well and it also supports

1884
01:40:47,270 --> 01:40:49,619
 portrait lighting all through the front 

1885
01:40:49,619 --> 01:40:52,969
sideto depth camera 

1886
01:40:57,640 --> 01:40:59,620
and people gonna be blown away butthe 

1887
01:40:59,620 --> 01:41:02,170
selfish you can take with theiPhone 10 

1888
01:41:02,170 --> 01:41:04,450
thisis absolutely beautiful of course 

1889
01:41:04,450 --> 01:41:06,280
 everything we've seen is powered and 

1890
01:41:06,280 --> 01:41:08,800
 iPhone 10 by the amazing new a 11 Bionic 

1891
01:41:08,800 --> 01:41:11,710
chip we talked all about aniPhone 8 but 

1892
01:41:11,710 --> 01:41:13,570
it's worth hittingon the highlights 

1893
01:41:13,570 --> 01:41:14,830
 again because there has never been 

1894
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:18,160
anything likeit a 64-bit 6 core 

1895
01:41:18,160 --> 01:41:21,160
designed4.3 billion transistors to 

1896
01:41:21,160 --> 01:41:22,450
 high-performance course for 

1897
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:24,370
high-efficiency cores our new 

1898
01:41:24,370 --> 01:41:26,260
 second-generation performance controller 

1899
01:41:26,260 --> 01:41:28,330
that uses allsix cores at once our 

1900
01:41:28,330 --> 01:41:30,940
first Apple design graphics processing

1901
01:41:30,940 --> 01:41:34,150
unitthe brand new ISP that improves 

1902
01:41:34,150 --> 01:41:36,580
 autofocus the video encoded that is 

1903
01:41:36,580 --> 01:41:39,430
real-time motion analysis while you're 

1904
01:41:39,430 --> 01:41:41,470
shootingvideo the knurl engine and of 

1905
01:41:41,470 --> 01:41:44,020
course the secure Enclaveto protect our 

1906
01:41:44,020 --> 01:41:46,510
face ID dataall this performance I'm 

1907
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,490
sure as youexpect does come with the 

1908
01:41:48,490 --> 01:41:50,710
hitto battery life so I think it's 

1909
01:41:50,710 --> 01:41:51,790
important totell you that we've 

1910
01:41:51,790 --> 01:41:56,880
increased it yes itlasts 

1911
01:42:00,909 --> 01:42:03,790
againhardware and software teams work 

1912
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,500
 really hard to deliver two more hours of 

1913
01:42:05,500 --> 01:42:09,250
all-day batterylife to us so wireless 

1914
01:42:09,250 --> 01:42:11,650
just likeiPhone 8 iPhone 10 is also 

1915
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:14,260
built for a wireless world it is Qi 

1916
01:42:14,260 --> 01:42:16,090
charging through theglass back and it 

1917
01:42:16,090 --> 01:42:17,830
willwork with the Qi charging devices 

1918
01:42:17,830 --> 01:42:19,389
like the onesthat we mentioned earlier 

1919
01:42:19,389 --> 01:42:21,850
fromMophie and Belkin it also worked 

1920
01:42:21,850 --> 01:42:23,530
withthird-party two devices that are Qi 

1921
01:42:23,530 --> 01:42:25,659
certified and there are alot of great 

1922
01:42:25,659 --> 01:42:27,070
 devices they're gonna start to come to 

1923
01:42:27,070 --> 01:42:28,600
marketparticularly because of iPhone 8 

1924
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:31,420
knifeown 10 but we also think we can 

1925
01:42:31,420 --> 01:42:33,130
make the wireless charging experience

1926
01:42:33,130 --> 01:42:36,070
 even better so our team wants to create 

1927
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:38,500
somethingI think all of us we're gonna 

1928
01:42:38,500 --> 01:42:40,449
wantto use and it might actually help 

1929
01:42:40,449 --> 01:42:43,330
move the entireindustry forward so 

1930
01:42:43,330 --> 01:42:44,679
we're gonna giveyou a sneak peek of 

1931
01:42:44,679 --> 01:42:48,850
this idea right nowI'm sure many of you 

1932
01:42:48,850 --> 01:42:51,100
do thisI do this have a lot of Apple 

1933
01:42:51,100 --> 01:42:52,540
productsI love them and use them all 

1934
01:42:52,540 --> 01:42:54,639
daylong I charge them at night you plug 

1935
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:56,560
in your cables you plug in yourchargers 

1936
01:42:56,560 --> 01:42:58,690
 you take those cables and charges with 

1937
01:42:58,690 --> 01:43:01,570
you on the roadwhen you travel we think 

1938
01:43:01,570 --> 01:43:03,489
we have anidea of how to make this a 

1939
01:43:03,489 --> 01:43:08,949
better experienceand here it is it's a 

1940
01:43:08,949 --> 01:43:10,750
matthat you place your iPhone 8 or 

1941
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,850
iPhone 10 down and itjust starts to 

1942
01:43:12,850 --> 01:43:14,830
chargeand there's a beautiful new 

1943
01:43:14,830 --> 01:43:17,949
interfaceit doesn't stop there you can 

1944
01:43:17,949 --> 01:43:19,960
place yourSeries 3 Apple watch down on 

1945
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:25,060
itand it starts to charge as well and 

1946
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:26,560
youcan place your ear pods or the 

1947
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,170
optionalnew wireless charging case on
