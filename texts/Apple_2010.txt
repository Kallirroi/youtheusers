it if we do so5200 attendees over 120 
sessionsover a hundred hands-on labs 
where you can take your code in and get 
tohelp tuning it and porting it to some 
ofour newer devices and there are over 
a hundred Apple engineershere this week 
a thousand sorryApple engineers here 
this weekto help you so there's a lot 
of app of folks floating around grab 
them make use of themand we hope you 
havea great week here at WWDC now we're 
goingto talk about three things today 
you know if the if the hardware isthe 
the brain and sinew of our productsthe 
softwarein them is their sole and today 
we are goingto talk about software we 
got some greatstuff to talk about 
OS10 Lion iOS 5 and some kind of 
interesting new cloud stuff so let's
start with Liontell us all about Lion 
I'm gonna ask to my colleagues Phil 
Schillerand Craig federighi to take us 
throughline and give us some demos Phil 
take thefeed 
oh good morning everyone how you doing 
yeah come on energy in the room this is 
the Developer Conference that's what I 
like it I am really honored to be the 
firstto present to you the first of our 
new products today in this product is 
allabout the Mac and the Mac is doing 
incredibly wellour customer base 
continues to grow at a tremendous pace 
we now have over 54 million active Mac 
users around theworld and growing the 
customers love the products and press
and Animus have really incredible things 
to say aboutit 
things like thisfrom All Things D 
there's really no other wayto say this 
the Mac is kicking ass now that's really
nice but what did John mean well this is 
what he meansthe last quarter the PC 
market actually shrank year-over-year 
one percent while the Mac grew 28% 
and mybook that's an ass-kicking now 
let's do you think this is an aberration
the Mac has outgrown the industry every 
quarter forthe past five years it is 
going so strong and it's because the 
productsare incredible products like 
the new MacBook Air it's beautifulits 
thinits light its fast the whole PC 
industrywants to copy it but as you 
know we've been leading in notebooks for 
a whilewe're the first to really drive 
the majority ofour PC business to a 
notebook business and it's almostthree 
quarters of the Mac's we've shipped 
today but whether you want a great new 
notebook or a killer desktop with the
new iMacthese Macs are the best that we 
have evermade in the history of Apple 
andthey're great not just because of 
the hardware they run but because ofthe 
softwareMac os10 is the heart of the 
Mac and if you'rekeeping track you know 
we launched Mac OS 1010 years ago we 
built it on a solidUNIX foundation we 
added toit the ease-of-use and 
simplicity that we know Apple is 
renowned for and we built intoit 
amazing technologies for all ofour 
great developers to make the world's
best applications to run onit and for 
thoseof you who are around and remember 
this thisis what Mac OS 10 looked like 
it was a revolution inits day in over 
thelast ten years it's evolved become 
more refined morepowerful more 
beautifulthan ever before the Mac os10 
is looking incredibly strongso where do 
we take it next well next up in OS 10 is 
lying a major release with over 250 new 
features and if you'dlike me to go 
throughevery one of them today yes well 
I'd love toI'm told I don't even have 
time totell you about ten key new 
featuresso we'll really get into ten 
awesome features first up right into it 
number one multi-touch gestures one of 
the great thingsabout the mat from the 
beginning was thatit uh sure Dan era of 
a graphic unit user interface with a
mouseand cooking and dragging but so 
much haschanged over the last 10 years 
we now build multi-touch trackpads into
all of our notebooks andwe offer them 
on our desktopswe've learned a lot from 
iOS as well 
so nowlion can count on multi-touch 
from the beginning youcan have 
beautiful fluidmomentum based scrolling 
you canhave incredible multi-touch taps 
to zoom in on stories or pictures you
can dynamically zoom with beautiful
fluid pinch motions you can swipe
throughyour photographs your slides 
yourweb pages all with an incredible 
physical realism that's never been
possible the PC operating system before 
and this has implications across the 
system anda lot of little important 
areas here's a simple examplethe scroll 
bar why do we have scrollbars scroll 
bars were there sothey could click with 
the mouse anddrag and scroll but now if 
you'repushing your window with 
multi-touch you don't need them they can 
disappear and if a much more beautiful 
reading environment but when you go to
scroll they magicallyappear give you a 
senseof place and proportional size and 
then disappear when youdon't need them 
so multi-touch is now built throughout
the system in a very powerful way number 
two 
full screen applicationswe've had some 
full screen applications before and 
theseare really important for notebooks 
get take advantage of every pixel onthe 
display but developers have hadto work 
hardto make their applications 
hand-coded to do full screen 
applications including apps like like
i photo well now with line we've built 
in a standardmethod for developers to 
createfull screen applications and it 
has a simplesystem control on the top 
rightso all users know where to tap and 
then bring their applications full
screen but thisis in full screen like 
it was before because now you can keep 
your application running full screen 
with a simple swipe gestureget back to 
your desktop get something you need go 
back to applicationnever having left 
full screen in fact you canhave more 
than one full screen application running 
at the same time so we'veworked on a 
numberof our applications to bring them 
into the new full screen mode of Lion 
system applications like Safari mail 
iCal iLife applicationsiPhoto iMovie 
GarageBandI work with keynote numbers 
and pages and all these applications 
goingfullscreen to have a great 
experience rightout of the box here's 
anexample of how it looks this is now 
runningfullscreen in Safari you can 
have a beautiful place for viewing your 
documentsand now there's a new feature 
since we've got all this extraroom on 
theleft-hand side called the reading 
listkeep track of things you want to 
get to later
here's iCal runningfullscreen here's 
preview showing you PDF documents
runningfullscreen so you can just have 
abeautiful experience like we've never 
had on a computer before with full 
screenapplications next feature for 
manyusers this will be the best feature 
of Lion it's called Mission Control now 
we all like torun a lot of software the 
Apple we've created many featuresto 
helpcustomers find just what they need 
expose for finding a document dashboard 
for getting at a quick widget spaces for 
organizingyour work environment but did 
it all work together inone unified way 
wellnow with line we've unified that 
with a simplegesture to get into 
Mission Controland this is a bird's-eye 
view ofeverything going on in your 
system on the main window well that's
the current desktopyou're working on 
withall the documents now organized by 
what application isrunning on them and 
youcan tap on any document and bring it 
to the front that'sright there Center 
for you to work on up above are allyour 
spaces so you can have multiple desktops
you can have multiple full screen apps 
running get to any one with a single tab 
on the left of those spacesas a new spa 
one just for your dashboard widgets you 
canget to again with a single tab 
so that's Mission Control andwhat I 
liketo do now is before we move on have 
Craig federighi come up and give you a
demo ofthese three new features all 
working togetherCraig hello good 
morning so 
let's take a lookat lion in action 
we're going to start with gestures great 
played it place to experience gestures 
is here in Safarithe first thing you'll 
notice is apparently something funny is 
thathow simple this UI looks because 
there are no scroll barsit's a really 
clean look we don't need scroll bars 
anymorebecause we can simply push the 
content with ourfingers we can flick 
and getmomentum get a nice little 
bounce the page feels really alive 
beneath your fingers you can also expand 
your fingers and fluidly zoom justlike 
thatzoom out and you get a nice little 
bounce page goes right back into place 
if I want to 
smart zoom I just double tapwith two 
fingersit's smart zooms in double tap 
againsmart zooms out now I want to show 
you something really cool
with gestures and that's how it can 
navigate in Safari I'm going to drill
into a storyand then after I've read it 
I want toactually get back to the 
previous page wellnow I can just take 
twofingers and swipe the page right off 
to theside and return back to my 
previous page
I wanna getback and swipe right back 
really fantastic
in fact I can swipe throughmy entire 
Safari browsing history justlike that 
really smooth next upI'd like to show 
youfull screen apps I'm gonna launch 
iPhoto here and you can seethat I 
photos adoptedlions and standard new 
full screen control so I'll just take 
lionor take iPhoto full screen it's a 
great way to lookat my photo album if I 
want toget back to my desktop take 
threefingers and I can just swipe the 
desktopswipe iPhoto way and back to my 
desktopbut I didn't have to leave 
iPhotoand take it out of full screen 
it's actually right there take a peek at 
itgo back just like that we love this 
somuch that we made gesture is 
accessible inexactly the same way swipe 
over tothe left and I have access to my 
dashboard you can see Safari supports
full screen as well let's gotake our 
safari window full screen so now we have 
our dashboard over our desktop over here 
to the leftwe have Safari and of course 
I photos still there in full screen as
wellyou'll notice how Safari is making 
great useof all the available space on 
the screen for my content but if I want 
to get at my bookmarks bar my menu just 
go to the topyou see they slide right 
out like that really nicely and when I 
wantto exit full screen I have a 
control rightthere in the upper right 
animates right back outlet's take a 
look nowat photobooth this is an app 
absolutely born to runin full screen 
you can see I'm surrounded by the 
curtains of the the photo boothand in 
hereI can experience some fantastic new 
face detectioneffects so notice as I 
move thebirds actually track 
it's right it's the most important
feature in line and wecan also use this 
face tracking technology to perform some 
targeted facial enhancements for
instanceI can finally have those big 
eyes thatI've always hoped for so that 
make a picture of that so that's that's 
pretty cool so playing around yeah 
that's great stuffso you know you can 
spendhours at this so fullscreen is 
fantasticbut of course Mac users love 
to get do a lotof things at once and 
that often meansthat they have a lot of 
windows in fact my desktop often looks a 
little bit morelike this right I've got 
a lotgoing on so how do I get across 
all of those differentactivities well I 
just takethree fingers swipe up on the 
trackpadand I'm in Mission Control from 
here I can get at any window I want so 
if I want to get itI Cal here I click 
it comes forwardsweet back into Mission 
Control over the dictionary same thing 
and across thetop you see I have my 
dashboardmy desktop my full screen apps 
so I want to get to iPhoto just click 
comes forwardfrom anywhere three 
fingers up and I'm back in Mission
ControlI can also quick look my windows 
if I just hit spacebar hereget a better 
look atmy calendar or take this pile of 
preview windows and spread themapart 
with a little gesture up but you know 
what'sreally awesome is the way that 
multiple desktop spaces are now
integrated right into Mission Control
just take my mouse up to the corner of 
the screen anda little space pops up I 
clickI've just created a new space and 
I canpopulate it by just dragging the 
windows I want to workwithin that space 
just like this and I've set up a new 
desk
really usefulI can swipe through the 
spacesof course here in admission 
control go over to my desktop and if I 
want tothen take even an entire app in 
all of its windows and create a new 
spacefor that I can click on the 
previewicon drag the whole pile to the 
cornerI've just created another space 
and the spaces are justas easy to clean 
up as they were to create I just click 
they delete and theyfloat windows fly 
right back to my original desktopspace 
so thatis Mission Control thank you 
very much 
Thank You Craigjust see how these new 
features now work seamlessly together to
createan incredible experience in OS 10 
unlike anything we'vehad on a personal 
computerbefore 
next upthe Mac App Store we launched 
the Mac App Store this past January and 
usershave found out that it is the best 
place to purchase and discover new 
software applications now for years 
there havebeen many software channels 
to buy PC software and they all work 
kindof the same way you hop in your car 
you drivedown town you buy a DVD if 
they happen to haveit you drive back 
home you load it up or you wait for it 
to comemail-order will no more well now 
withthe Mac App Store you can get your 
software right from the comfort of your 
own homeon your Mac and in the last six 
monthssomething incredible has happened 
the last six months the Mac App Store 
has now become the number one PC 
softwarechannel for buying software 
that's incredible 
passing Best Buy andWalmart and Office 
Depot and the developers that have 
gottenon board with the Mac App Store 
have seen somegreat success - for 
example Autodesk they brought their 
SketchBook Pro application to it and
sincethey've put it on the Mac App 
Store they've seen a millionnew users 
on the Mac feral interactive has brought
a hostof games including Mini Ninjas 
hopefully you've allplayed it doubling 
of overall revenue sincethey brought it 
to the Mac App Store and small great 
developers likePixelmator has brought 
the amazing new image editing
application to the Mac App Storethey've 
seen a quadrupling ofthe revenue in 
fact they made a milliondollars in 
theirfirst 20 days so the Mac App Store 
has been a big hit for large and small 
developers so what's newin Lion well 
firstit's built right in you don't 
forget it and get it and decide to use 
itit's built-in for every Mac user and 
there's a lotof great features for you 
developers to takeadvantage of some of 
them you're used to fromthe iOS App 
Store like in-app purchases you cannow 
build those in push notifications if you
want to alert usersabout important 
informationyou can make your 
applications more secure there's a
built-in sandboxing method now in the
MacApp Store and for users downloads 
will be even fasterbecause you can get 
theseupdates as Delta updates 
so that's theMac apps on it's a really 
importantpart of the whole experience 
of line is you'll hear more about number 
five a simple but powerful idea 
launchpad would it be great if no matter 
where you arein your system if you want 
to getat an application and quickly 
launch ityou can with a simple gesture 
well now you can with launchpad you 
simply makea simple gesture a pinch 
motion and all your applications fly
ontoyour screen no matter where they 
arein your system launchpad knows where 
they areyou can have multiple pages of 
applications thatyou can organize any 
way you want when you go andbuy a new 
application on the Mac App Store and 
downloads installs rightinto your 
launchpad and you can make it look 
however you like you can rearrange your 
icons youcan create folders just as 
we're used tofrom iOS and now you can 
dothat on your Mac as well so that's 
launch pad next resume here's a simple 
ideafrom the beginning with the 
computeryou've had to run applications 
sometimes you quit them you go back and 
you're backat the starting point you 
get you have no more windows open your
documentsaren't open you usually have 
to pick a templatewhy can't a plication 
x' get you back to work quickly well 
that'sit resume does now when you 
launch anapplication and lyan it brings 
youright back to where you were when 
you quitit remembers what documents you 
were opened remembers the text that was 
selected in the document remembers where 
thepalettes were and the windows and 
everything just how you like it and 
resume doesn'twork just on an 
applicationit works system-wide so the 
next time you have to shutdown and 
restart your your Mac for a reason maybe 
you've installed some new software and 
asked you to reboot get you like 
everythingjust the way it is well don't 
worry you get the new login window you 
log inand lion will bring you back to 
the work environmentas you left it when 
you restartedall your applications 
running all those spaces you set up all 
just the way you like it
so that's resumed number seven autosave 
from the beginning of using computers 
we've all had toremember one really 
important factsave save save all your 
workas you're going whether it's file 
save or commandS on a Mac you better 
keep savingas the one time you might 
forgetto save what you're doing 
somethinggoes wrong and what are you 
goingto hear you should have saved what 
you're doing why should you whycan't 
the computer help youwell that's what 
lion does as you're creating a document 
lion can automatically save it in the
background without you having to do 
anythingwithout you having to see 
anything your work is just being saved 
for you this is a really powerful but 
simple thing but but as we got into we 
found there's more thingswe can do for 
you since we're Auto saving so if you 
zoomin on the title bar of your 
documents you'll see the nameof your 
documentis actually a menu now that you 
can tap on and take advantageof the 
powerof autosave but for example let's 
say you're doing work and you don't like 
the work youdid and you're worried it 
gotauto saved over what you liked that 
you've done previouslywell now I can 
just select revert to last open and get 
back towhere you were when you started 
and maybe you love the changes you've 
madeand they're exactly what you want 
youdon't want it to ever get auto saved 
overit again because it's perfect the 
wayit is you can just select lock and 
now yourdocuments locked it's like a 
templateand nothing can ever change it 
you can even right from within the 
application so like duplicate and create 
a seconddocument just like the first 
one that you can start working on 
anotherversion so you have the power of 
all ofthis right from the title bar of 
your window so that'sauto save now auto 
save gave us a great idea to go even 
furtherwith the next feature and that's 
called versions so you're workingon a 
document you'reentering the text you're 
formattingyou're adding copy you're 
adding graphicsand all along autosave 
is saving your document in fact it's 
savingall these versions of your 
document as you're working so we call 
that versions it's automatic youdon't 
have to do anything we'll do it for you 
withLion if you love something at a 
split second you can of coursetake a 
manual snapshot if you want and it's
very efficientwe only store the 
difference betweenthe versions they're 
not whole new documents 
and youdon't have to worry if you ever 
share your work withsomeone else that 
they're goingto get all that back work 
that youwon't don't want them to get 
whenyou copy it off or you send it an 
emailwe only send the current version 
so how doyou get it take advantage of 
thispower of autosave inversions 
well againgo back to that menu on the 
topand there's another choice there 
that you may have noticed browse all 
versionsyou tap on it and you get this 
beautiful new interface it looks a lot 
liketime machine but rather than being 
about your whole system it's about that 
onedocument you're working on on the 
leftis the current version on the right 
all the past versions you have a time 
scaleon the right just like time 
machineyou can scroll back through them 
and they're all live you can switch to 
make anyone the current one you can even 
cut and paste between them so that's 
versionswhat I'd like to do is ask 
Craig to come back up andgive another 
demoshowing how this all works together 
Craig again all right well let's let's 
start with launchpad you see it's an 
iconright here on my dock I click I get 
an instant viewof all of the 
applications on my system no matter 
where they're installedI can page 
through themreally nicely with gestures 
and when I want tolaunch let's say like 
address bookit's just a single click to 
bring it up can also gesture with a 
forefinger pinch to get in as well 
so of course when I want toadd things 
to mylaunch pad the best way to do that 
iswith the Mac App Store I'm going to 
launch it righthere you can see on the 
Mac App Store we have great featured
applicationstop paid and free apps 
categories we havealso all of your 
purchase tabsso then if you buy another 
Mac or you buy on one Mac you wantto 
get the app on the other one
youcan download them here at no 
additional chargeand of course updates 
with just aclick you can bring all the 
apps youhave installed on your system 
from the App Store 
up to date well now let's try adding 
Twitter to our Mac we're going to click 
here and go to the Twitter product page 
and with a clickyou can buy the app 
actually lifts up out of theApp Store 
andflies right into my Launchpad 
downloads and is ready to use 
from here I canjust click and position 
it wherever I wantI can move it maybe 
to the first page
and as you seewe have folders like this 
productivity folderworks great I want 
to create my own folderjust pick 
something up drop it and I've created a 
folderjust like that in Launchpad next 
I'dlike to show you just how fantastic 
the Mac is now with Lion working with 
documents I'm going to open the document 
that I've been working on here on the 
history of guitarswhen I start editing 
a documentoften I'll position my 
windows just the way I like them like 
this maybe open up some inspectors 
position them the way I want them and 
then I'll set down to editing now this 
guitar this looks maybe a little bittoo 
metal for my target audience all delete
that take take this move it asidemaybe 
change the font hereon this on this 
documentso I'm done with my edits for 
now and I'm gonna quit and I want you to 
watch what happens when I quit 
absolutely nothing
I wasn't prompted to saveI didn't need 
to be because lion was actually saving 
for me all along but it wasn't just 
savingmy document it was saving exactly 
the state of how I was workingso now 
when I go back and launch pages again 
you see itbrings back all my inspectors 
just the way they werebrings back my 
window position where it was andeven 
has my text selection highlighted just
as I left it perfect restore but we're 
notjust storing the latest version of 
thedocument we're keeping a history of 
thedocument as it's edited so if I want 
to go back maybe I regret these edits I 
want to getback to the previous version 
I go right here and browse all versions 
and I'm taken right into the star field 
where I get a view of my current version 
on theleft and the history on the right 
if I wantthis previous version to 
becomecurrent I click restore it picks 
up flies on top and becomes the current
version of my document and I'm restored 
butyou saw that was actually more 
history than that I'll go back into the 
star field here you can see I actually 
have a full timeline here on the right I 
cango back to the very beginning of 
this document when it was just a few 
paragraphsor step forward as I was 
adding pagesand so forth but when I 
restorea document you know very often I 
don't wantreally the holo version I 
likemostly what my new document has 
become but often I want to harvest maybe
just an image or perhaps a particular
slide andbring it into the current 
version with versions I can because 
these two windows are actually live here 
so if I have on my current version maybe 
a page that could really use an image to 
punch it upa little bit I go back to 
thispast version I see oh look there's 
there's aguitar that would be just 
perfectwell I can just select the 
guitarand the old version copy it and 
then pasteit right into the latest 
version and like that I've created just 
the document I was looking for and 
that'sversion thanks Thank You Craig 
next number9 well as long as we've had 
computerswe wanted to share documents 
we have a new feature to help you do 
thatand make it easier than ever it's 
called airdrop you've got your computer 
your friends got their computer and 
trying toget documents between them has 
always beensuch a pain in fact the 
easiest way to do this that no one's 
done better than is good old sneakernet 
copy it off of one walk over to your 
friend's computer copy it back on 
Millian solves that with a new 
technologyairdrop that's a peer-to-peer 
Wi-Fi based networkso how does it work 
when you go intothe finder in line 
you'llsee on the sources on the Left a 
new choicecalled airdrop you tap it you 
get a new display inside the finder what 
you see isyourself Center bottom right 
thereand the people around you who are 
alsorunning airdrop at the same time 
you see their picturesI want to drag a 
document over to Shawna's computer I
justdragged the document on top of her 
picture andit asked me are you sure you 
want to sendthis and I confirm I do I'm 
Shauna's computer because she's also now
running airdrop she sees pops up overmy 
pictureI'm trying to send her a 
document she confirms she wants to
receiveit and it downloads right into a 
downloads folder and that's it that's 
what it takes to now wirelessly share 
files betweenLyon computers so it's a 
peer-to-peer Wi-Fi basednetwork there's 
nothing toset up its auto-discovery 
Auto setup we have confirmation on both 
ends just tobe safe 
and your data isprotected over-the-air 
because it's fully encrypted as it's 
transferred so that's airdropand that 
brings usto number ten number ten is 
maila completely new version of mail 
online it's beautiful the layout on it 
is incredible
it works in a window it takesadvantage 
of fullscreen you can work in a two 
column or if you want to have access to 
yourmail sources a three column view 
right thereon the left and you see that 
the design of it's really optimized 
aroundreading your mail have a 
beautiful full height message windowon 
the left and the message listyou see 
snippets like we used tofrom iOS now 
builtinto mail across the top you have 
a favorites barsort of like a browser 
does now in mail that can be favorite
folders where you like to keepthings 
you want toget at quickly probably the 
most one of themost powerful features 
is searching withsearching now we have 
new search suggestionsso you start to 
type what you'relooking for and mail 
recognizeswhether that's a person or a 
subjectand prompts you with the choices 
you haveacross your entire mail 
databasewhat you can find quickly when 
you selectone it becomes what we call a 
search token that'san interactive 
search token where you can set some
parameterson it and you can have more 
than one and create boolean searches if 
you wantbut probably the best feature 
of the new mail is something we callyes 
youcan love that it's okay boolean 
searches
probably the best feature somethingwe 
call conversationview in male today as 
you've got a conversationgoing you've 
gotsome messages you've responded to or 
replied andforwards you see the mail 
gets longerand longer and they're 
indentedand color coded things stripped 
outit gets more and more difficult to 
follow the flow of this and appreciate 
the messagesthat were sent well now in 
line there's abrand-new conversation 
view that shows your messagesjust as 
they weresent you see the messages you 
see thepeople who send them you see the 
attachments still in line all there for 
youto view it it's completely 
compatible with doing email with other 
people whodon't have line and can't get 
the same beautiful view so that's male 
and lion I'd like to bring Craig up for
onelast demo to show off male ok well I 
absolutelylove the new male in lion 
let's let's take a lookso it's got this 
greatfull height message list perfect 
for laptopsjust like this I've got my 
message list on the side with snippets
makes it really easyto find the message 
I'm looking forwith this new favorites 
bar across thetop so I can click 
through mymailboxes really easily but 
if I want to get back to my full list 
they're available right here as well I 
really find the new search to be just
awesomebecause when I search I'm often 
searching for a person let's say like 
PhilI start typing pH see it prompts me 
forpeople in my mail right now that 
match so I go Phil Schillerfound 
messages from Phil just like thatI can 
useit can retarget the search to 
specificinboxes or search all and of 
courseas Phil showed you I can pick 
whether I'm searching forfrom two or 
the entiremessage 
wellsuggestions don't just apply to 
searching for peoplethey also work for 
other things as well like let's say a 
subject I'll search forTripp you see 
that it's actually prompting me do you
wantto search for messages that contain 
Tripp or where Tripp justappears in the 
subjectline or even suggest specific 
subject lines that matchso I can select 
thisand I've done a subject search on 
Trippwhat about dates I'm going to type 
March start typing March there you see
it promptsme March 2011 
like thatI've searched for all my 
messages in March but what's really 
awesome is the way you can combine these 
reallyquickly to pinpoint just the 
search you're looking for solet's say 
lookingfor a message about that Phil 
sent me it's the subjectwas something 
about reservationit was from Phil 
Schillerand it was last month like that 
drills down to exactly the message we're 
looking for it's really nice
as awesome as thatis my favorite 
feature is conversationsit's this 
beautifulview of all the messages that 
were sent in the conversation just as 
they were sentwith all the images and 
so forth and you'll notice that all of 
that extra forwarded reply text that's 
redundantin the conversation is 
strippedright out it's gone but if I 
wantto show it I want to see mail the 
way it kind of looks inlessor mail 
programsI can click like this it folds 
rightout yeah this is awesome if I want 
to replyto a particular message in a 
conversation I can hover we get a reply 
control and watchthis animation loop so 
message hopsright out so that's great 
andfinally when you want to file a 
wholeconversation away you can just 
drag it all at once
drag all the messages put it your folder 
and you're done that's mail in line 
thank you 
so those are thetop ten features of 
mail and there's so much use we have 
lion and there is so much more for you 
tolearn about and discover and lion 
amazing features just to bring up a few 
and don't windows users who wantto 
upgradeto a Mac deserve a migration 
feature justlike we Mac users have well 
now thereis in line when you upgrade 
fromWindows we can help you migrate and 
get to abetter computing experience 
there's File Vault- yeah so for all of 
you who want more security and 
encryption on your hard drive you have 
that facetimes built in even servers all

that can easily be done with all these 
newAPI s so line is an incredible new 
new release so how are wegoing to get 
it well inthe past one thing every 
versionof Mac OS 10 is shared in common 
isit came on an optical disk no more 
now line we available only in the Mac 
App Store 
and that allows usto make it the 
easiest upgrade you have ever seen when 
it's ready you'll go intothe Mac App 
Store and you'll see a page there where 
you can readabout it see screenshots 
read reviews when you're ready clickbuy 
and it downloads right onto your Mac and 
starts the upgradeprocess right there 
so it's on the Mac App Store to be about 
as a single HD movie that you might
downloadit installs right in place no 
more rebooting from anoptical disk and 
because it's partof the Mac apps from 
the Mac App Store rules it follows the 
same rules when you purchase ityou can 
useit on all of your personal 
authorized Mac's you have to buy
multiplecopies that's lying 
I know what you're thinking whatshould 
we chargefor this but what would you 
charge in the past most major leases of 
Mac OS10 have been one hundred and 
twenty nine dollars and I think there's 
a lot herefor $129 but we love it so 
much that we want to make it available 
toeven more people so we're going to 
price it at just $29.99 
I was hoping you'regonna like that so 
when doyou all get your hands on it 
here at theconference we're gonna have 
a Developer Previewthe latest developer 
preview available today for you to 
downloadand take advantage of 
everything you've seen up here and for

iOSfive before I get into the cool 
stuff let me give you a quick update on 
iOSas you know iOS powers the iPhone 
theiPad and the iPod Touch and to date 
we have soldwait for it over two 
hundred million iOS devices 
and that makes iOS the number one mobile
operating system with more than 44 
percent at forty four percent of the 
market now the latestaddition to the 
iOS family is the iPad 2which is an 
incredible producteven thinner and 
lighterthan the original it comes in 
black andwhite that has cameras on the 
front and back it is an amazing product

already sold more than 25 million iPads 
we createda whole new category of 
device with the iPad and have sold more 
than 25 million with the iPad to joins

momentum of the App Store is really hard 
to fathom there are currently more than 
more than90 thousand of these were made 
specifically forthe iPad it takes full 
advantage of the large touchscreen 
display and they make the iPad a better 
productso we'd like to thank our 
developers for these great apps

dollarsto developers building apps for 
the App Store thank you 
now theseapps as you know cover every 
genre imaginablethere's great travel 
apps like this walking tour from Lonely

games I'd say evenmind controlling the 
addictive games like tiny wingsgreat 
entertainment titles like HBO GO which 
lets you takeHBO wherever you are and 
you can watch it right on your iPad 
they're deep apps like mobile mem which 
allow physicians tolook at CT scans and 
PET scansright on their iPad and this

with an incredible lineupof iOS devices 
let's talk about thefuture of iOS and 
that is iOS 5
iOS 5 is a major releasethis is 
incrediblefor our developers and for 
our customers 
for developers there are more than 1500 
new api's and some great enhancementsto 
our toolsfor our for our users there 
morethan 200 new features let me go 
aheadand walk you through ten now 
number one notifications
I'm sure you'reall familiar with 
notifications we look something like
thisit looks best when giants are on 
top soyou get scoring alerts you have 
alerts to pop up theyget into audio 
they can also badgethe home screen 
icons well these have been massively 
popular in fact we have alreadypushed 
more than ahundred billion push 
notificationsis scaled beautifully 
we've heardfrom our customers that are 
receivingso money they'd like a better 
UI to get them and we agree and so we
have builtsomething that solves some of 
theproblems in the current one 
currently when you get a notificationit 
interrupts you if you're playing a game
you get a modal alert you have to deal 
with that mode alert before you can go 
onalso in the lock screen you get this 
nice list ofthings that have happened 
while your phone's been locked but when 
you unlock itthat list isn't persistent 
there's no way to get back to that list 
and go through those notifications well 
we have designed a solution thatsolves 
those issuesand goes far beyond it and 
we call it notification center
Notification Center is a single place
which combines together all of your 
notifications you can get to it at any 
time from anywhere on your iPhone or 
iPad oriPod touch just by swiping your 
finger downfrom the top to reveal the 
Notification Center
so we thinkit is beautiful it has your 
missed callsand voicemails text 
messages mail messages scoringalerts 
Facebook updatesany push notifications 
thatcome from the App Store all end up 
righthere in Notification Center and 
we've evenadded stocks and weather 
right up topnow we didn't stop there 
notifications are no longer interrupting
so now if you're playing a game and 
someonesends you say a text message a 
nice animationfrom the top it's right 
thereyou can keep on playing your game 
andit'll automatically dismiss itself 
you could have just tapped on it who 
take you to that app but doesn't matter 
becauseyou can always get back to it 
any time just by swiping your finger 
downfrom the top we've also improved 
thelock screen you can see more 
information for notifications here and 
oneof my favorite features is for any 
one of the notifications in the lock 
screenyou can just slide your finger 
acrossit and it takes you directly to 
the app that sent the notification let 
me go aheadand just show this to you 
now so I've got a phone here runningiOS 
just going to swipe my finger right 
across that text message and it takes me 
directly tothe messages app and right 
into the conversation it's really 
convenientnow to get to the 
Notification Center just swipe my finger
down from the top and there it is 
dismiss it by swiping up really nice 
animationyou can see that we're still 
in winter here in San Francisco I get 
allof my messages here so text messages 
and scoring alertsdown at the bottom 
here I have some alerts from mlb.com at 
batif I tap on that X button I can just 
go aheadand clear that out if I see 
another notification like the Facebook 
oneI tap on it takes me directly to the 
Facebook app so it's really convenient
and at any time again swipe down from 
the top andyou get 
back toNotification Center and that is 
Notification Center
number two is newsstandyou know I love 
reading newspapersand magazines right 
on my iphone my iPad and recently we 
added subscriptionsthis makes it easier 
for you get all the new issues without 
missing anythingalready 
most of the major publishersof 
magazinesand many of newspapers have 
signed up tosupport subscriptions these 
are incredible titlesthings like 
NationalGeographic and spin to great 
music magazines and of course when you
read these on your iPad you getaudio 
and video in addition to all the 
articles Vanity Fair science magazines 
like Popular Mechanics andpopular 
science Esquire GQ fashion magazines
like ElleThe Oprah Magazine tech 
magazines like Wired and automobile
magazines and sports magazinesThe New 
Yorker and newspapers new ones like the 
daily butalso the New York Times the 
SanFrancisco Chronicle Daily Telegraph 
andother international papers and we've 
now created a single place rightin the 
app store thatcombines all of these 
newspaper and magazinesso you can find 
themall in one place when you purchase 
them they're automatically downloaded
and placed in the newsstandit's a new 
place right onthe home screen looks 
like it's beautifulnews rack in 
addition to this we do background
downloads
so if a newissue comes out say of a 
newspaperwhile you're sleeping when you 
wake upand pick up your iPad that new 
newspaperis already there ready for you 
to read it and you can read it offline 
on topof this we set the cover to be 
the front page of the new newspaperand 
we'll set it to be the cover of the new 
magazine for magazines 
so that is newsstand next is Twitter now
as I'm sureeveryone's familiar Twitter 
is an incredibly popular service people
send more thana billion tweets per week 
andwe hear from a lot of our customers 
on iPhoneand iPad and iPod touch that 
they love Twitterand so we want to make 
it eveneasier for all of our customers 
to use Twitter on iOS products we're 
doing a numberof things for this first 
we're addingsingle sign-on so now when 
you goto the Settings app its built in 
on the iPhone or iPad you can enter your 
username and password and now you're 
configured for Twitter for any app you
download off the App Store it'll just 
say can Iuse your credentials when you 
say yes you're logged in you don'tneed 
to relogin every single time so single 
sign-on
next we've integrated Twitter in with
manyof our apps like camera and photos 
so now if you're at a concert you take a 
photoand you want to tweet that photo 
just tap on the action button it's a new 
option tweetand it brings up this 
beautiful tweet sheet gives you a nice
thumbnail of the photo give you a 
countdown ofhow many characters you 
have left to type and youcan even 
optionally add your locationtap on that 
and then you've tweeted the photo it's 
that simple in addition to tweetingfrom 
photos and camera you can tweet articles
from Safari websites you can tweet 
videos from YouTube and youcan tweet 
about businesses or locations for maps 
beyond all of this we added integration 
with contacts now you might havea lot 
of contacts that don't have photos but 
Twitter may have photos for those people
and soyou can use Twitter to 
automaticallyupdate the photos in your 
contact list and even the at user name 
for your friendsand that's Twitter 
integration throughout the OS
next isSafari 
you knowSafari is the best mobile web 
browser outthere it's also the most 
popular in fact nearly two-thirds of all 
mobileweb browsing is done on Safari 
beyond this we took apples Safari engine 
and open sourced it and it's the basis
of all web browsing onAndroid so Safari 
engine is the basisof more than 90% of 
all webbrowsing on mobile devices well 
iOS5 we're making Safari even better 
we've got some great features the first 
isreader Safari reader becomes 
available up here as a new button when 
you're reading a storyon a website if 
youjust tap on that button we take the 
story you're reading and make it front 
andcenter we get rid of all the 
distractions set the font size rights 
and even if it's amulti-page story so 
you'd haveto tap through multiple web 
pages normally to get to itwe put in a 
singlescrolling story it's really 
convenient 
on topof that you can out email the 
contents ofthe story before you can 
just email the link but now when you 
email youget the link plus the contents 
in your compose window and all and all 
of this works really well on the iPad it 
worksgreat on the iPhone as well it's a 
perfect sizefor it sets the font size 
right it's really nice to read stories 
so that's the Faro reader the second one 
is readinglists reading lists is a 
simple and convenientway for you to 
quickly save a story to read it later 
just put it in the reading list and when 
you add an item toreading list it gets 
addedto the reading list on all of your 
iOSdevices and even the reading list on 
Safari on Macand Safari on Windows 
so if you don't have timeto finish it 
here on the iPad you can finish reading 
it lateron your iPhone and the next 
feature istabbed browsing we have added 
fulltab browsing and Safari on the iPad 
and you know letme just show it to you 
alright so here I have iPad running iOS 
thing you'llsee with tab browsing is it 
is lightningfast to switch between 
Windows now just tap onit and you're 
there great now I'mon the DP review 
site which is a fantasticreview site 
for camerasand they have really 
extensive reviews in fact youdon't have 
to tap through many manypages to read 
the whole review but I like this one 
here it's a 20 pages long well if I tap 
the readerbutton here it loads the 
entire story up andreader now I can 
just scroll through it gets rid of all 
thedistractions lets me concentrate 
justin the content that is reader 
you even see thatwhen it goes between 
pages here where you would have had to 
you know tap to say next page it 
automaticallygives you a little page 
breakso you know when it's going

really great Safari enhancements and 
Twitter integration throughout
all right next up these are reminders 
youknow all of us are constantly 
creating lists of things list of things 
todo list of things to buy like a 
grocery listsome of them have a place 
associated likedon't forget to walk the 
dog when I get homeand some have a time 
associated say buy concert tickets
Monday at 10:00 a.m. so that's when they 
go on salewouldn't be great if you get 
rid of all these scraps of paper and 
storeall this on your phone but beyond 
that if your phoneactually reminded you 
to do things as opposed to just 
statically keeping a list of things well 
that's exactlywhat the reminders app 
does on the reminders app youcan store 
listsof things multiple lists of things 
for a trip to San Francisco or birthday 
party or a grocerylist you can store 
dates associated with these reminders so 
you'll be remindedon that date you can 
also sign location this isreally cool I 
could set upa reminder to say remind me 
to call my wife when I leave the 
conventiontoday and it'll set a 
geofence
up aroundMoscone Center and so when I 
getin my car to leave it will pop up 
and takeall 
it solves theproblem of unliving right 
now I promisecall on the car you can of 
course search throughall your reminders 
and reminders will syncwith iCal on the 
Mac usingCalDAV and even without look 
on Windows usingexchange and that is 
reminders
next is camerayou know the iPhone 4 is 
widelyregarded as having one of the 
best cameras on a mobile phone it's also 
one of the most popular in factif you 
look at cameras used to take photos and
then post them toFlickr now this is all 
cameras not just cameras on phonesyou 
see where the iPhone 4 is it is already
by far the most popular camera on a 
phone to take photos and it very soon 
will bethe most popular camera overall 
we want to make using the camera even 
betterand that's what we're doing the 
firstthing we're doing is making it way 
faster just get in and takea photo 
so now ifthere's some moment happening 
your kids doing something really cute 
youwant to capture it you double click 
that home button you get a new camera 
iconwhen you tap on that camera icon 
you're brought directly and immediately 
to the camera and you're ready to take a 
photonow what's really cool about this 
iseven if you have a passcode set we'll 
take you rightinto take a new photo 
we'll protect it and you can't see any 
previous photos you'vetaken or anything 
elsein the phone without typing your 
passcode being start taking a passcodea 
picture immediatelyand you can even use 
thevolume up button now to click 
that sound I think people say use the 
shutter buttonto turn your volume up so 
in additionto this we've added optional 
gridlinesso you can use the rule of 
thirds to compose your photo or line it 
up you can now pinch to zoom right 
within the cameraand if you hold your 
finger over part of the scene now we'll 
set the auto exposureand auto focus 
lockyou can even move it around you 
know stick to that 
now this is a reallyadvanced feature 
when we broughtit to the iPhone and 
we've made it really easy for everyone 
to use 
now nextonce you've taken your great 
photosyou can now edit them right on 
your iPhone and your iPad you do things 
like crop and rotate redeye reductionso 
if you'vetaken the photo at left where 
the flash has caused aredeye you can 
automatically remove that redeye
righton your iPhone or iPad and we even 
brought over theone-click enhance that 
we pioneeredin iPhoto on the Mac and it 
broughtthat to iOS so you can see when 
you applied one tapenhance to the right 
how the color tones look so much nicer 
how it pulls detail out of shadow it's 
really niceso some great photo editing 
features and reallynice camera 
enhancements
next ismale now male is one of the most 
used applicationson both the iPhone 
iPod andiPod Touch iPad and iPod Touch 
and we're making it even better in iOS 5 
we're adding rich text formatting so you 
can set thingsas bold italic and 
underline you can control the 
indentation so you're forwarding
something you can uh ninten it's or 
further indent it you can now dragthe 
addresses betweentwo CC and BCC don't 
have to retypethem again we've added 
support for flagging so you can flag and 
unplug this next one has been a
incredibly popular requestin addition 
to searchingfrom two and subject you 
can searchthe entire contents of all 
your messagesboth the messages on your 
phone and all the messages back on the 
mailserver so search the entire 
contents ofyour messages for the iPad 
we added areally nice swipe to inbox 
gesture so it makes it really nice to 
use this in portrait so you swipe it on
tap on something swipe it off and with 
every release ofIowa spot or is we 
continueto add more support for our 
enterprisecustomers and one example of 
that in iOS 5 is we added support for 
s/mime so now I think we've done a 
reallynice job of this now if you have 
the certificateof someone else you 
automatically get this lock icon right
in the addressing field just to show you
this willbe encrypted 
when sent to the other person let me 
just go ahead and give you a demo of few 
ofthese features now alright so first I 
can show you a simple gesture I just 
pull on theinbox right from there so 
anywhereyou are when your porch adjust 
pull iton you have to go hunt up and 
find the rightbutton for it you can see 
we're flagging here so I can tap on that 
flagged messagea one other feature 
we've added is a builtin dictionary 
throughout the OS as a service now so 
before we had a dictionary inthe iBooks 
app but wenow brought that 
to the entire OS so all apps from the 
App Store can use it so here if I press 
downlets and lychees I don't know what 
thatis let's say I get a define in 
addition to copy tap define there it is
built-in dictionary it's great if I say 
respond to thismessage again I can grab 
oneof these addresses now just drag it 
to BCC dragged itto and rearrange it 
it'sreally nice and easy as one more 
feature I want to showyou it's actually 
a system-wide feature having to do with 
the keyboardwhen we released the 
original iPhone we revolutionized the 
way people would tight onmulti-touch 
displays and we keep on challenging
ourselvesto make that even better we 
have a new variantof the keyboard in 
iOS 5 for theiPad which we think people 
who like to type with their thumbs while 
holding it are reallygoing to like in 
thebottom right you see the keyboard 
button and now has some grab handlesif 
I justtake those and drag it up it 
splits itinto two 
so what it does is it moves the keys 
closer to your thumbs on theside so you 
can you can put it wherever you want 
it's really nice and it's persistent for 
every app in the systemit just stays 
whereyou put it 
we want to put it back downjust press 
andhold to dock and merge it goes back 
down to the bottom so even a split 
keyboard
that'smail number eight PC free 
so we built these incredible devicesthe 
iPhonethe iPad and people get them home 
they openup their box and I see this I 
say well what now we're living in a post 
PC world in fact especially with the 
iPad we're offering in the post PC world
we have a lotof customers coming to us 
andsaying I want to buy an iPad as my 
only device I don't know in a computer I 
wantto buy an iPhone is my only device 
my only actuallyinternet access for 
where I livewill be my iPhone 
we know we're selling into a lotof 
places where the households just don't 
have computersand they want to buy an 
iOSdevices their only device and that's 
exactlywhat we're going to support an 
iOS 5now you take your iPhone out of 
the box insteadof seeing this you're 
goingto see this 
you can now set up and activate your
device right on the device and you are 
readyto go it's that easy and of course 
there's someother things we had to do 
tomake this possible software updates 
are now over-the-air 
so you no longerneed to go and plug 
into acomputer just to update your 
software and of course they're now Delta 
updates so instead ofdownloading the 
entire OS you just download what's 
changednow the next thing we did is we 
we looked at all ofthe apps in the 
iPhone iPad iPod touch and asked 
ourselves what are thereasons that 
people go back to a computer today and 
let's add that functionalityright to 
iOSso for instance you have to go back 
to a computerto create calendars or 
delete calendarsyou can now create and 
delete calendarsright from iOS you saw 
for photos we've added really 
significant editing functionality in
there so you cancrop rotate one tap 
enhance redeye reductionright from 
withinyour iOS device even in mail now 
you can create mailboxes and delete 
mailboxes right fromiOS so we looked at 
all ofthe apps in the i phone and the 
ipad added that functionality so now if 
youwant to cut the cord you can 
next is gamecenteriOS is the most 
popular gamingplatform on the planet 
there are more than a hundred thousand 
game and entertainment titlesin the App 
Storeand so about nine months ago we 
launched Game Center and we did it to 
make it even easier for people to find 
playersto play games against and also 
to makeit easy for you to compare how 
you're doingagainst your friends well 
in justnine months we have 50 million 
Game Center users now to put that into 
perspectiveXbox Live has been around 
forabout eight years and they have 
around 30 millionusers so Game Center 
is verypopular and we're making it even 
better in iOS 5 to make it more fun and 
social we're addingphotos you can see 
photos of your friends change your 
photos you cannow compare yourself 
against yourfriends using achievement 
pointsper game you can see friends of 
friendsas well you also will get 
recommendedfriends that might be great 
people to place on the games that you 
like
we've also added gamerecommendations so 
there might be somereally great games 
outthere maybe they're new that you 
don't knowabout and we'll help you 
discover those once you'vediscovered a 
game you likeyou can purchase and 
downloadit directly from Game Center 
now this is great both for our customers 
andfor our developers another thing 
we've done forour developers is we've 
added supportfor turn-based games right 
in to the OS 
there are some great turn-based games
out therelike Scrabble but the 
developer had to do all thework for 
that and now that's supported right out 
ofthe box in iOS 5 so some really nice 
enhancements toGame Center 
next is iMessage nowI believe we have 
the best messaging client out there on 
the iPhoneit works tremendously well to 
send textmessages and photos and videos 
and our customerslove it our iPhone 
customers but whatabout our iPad 
customers and our iPodTouch customers 
they've been asking us fora messaging 
solutionand so in iOS 5 we're launching 
a new messaging service betweenall iOS 
and we call it iMessage soI message 
supports the iPhonethe iPad and the 
iPod touch it does everything you've 
come to expectfrom our messaging app on 
the iPhoneso you can send text messages 
photos videos send contacts do group
messaging everything you come to expect
and we've added some really nice new 
features things like delivery receipts
so you can see if it's been delivered to 
the other person's device optional read 
receiptsso you can see if it's been 
read this is why myfavorite typing 
indication so you can tell now if
someone starts typing and they're 
responding toyou you know you're about 
to get that message I messages are 
pushed to all your devicesso if you 
start a conversation onyour iPad and 
later pick up youriPhone you can pick 
up right where you left off with all the 
context of thatconversation to date is 
supported over both 3G and Wi-Fiand 
everything is sent encryptedover the 
where over there over the air and I like 
to just giveyou a demo of iMessage now 
to do so I also like toinvite up jaws 
vice president of product marketing to 
helpme hey does Scott thanks for having 
meabsolutely you don't mind I'm a play 
game though uhplaying again okay try 
not to bother me right here frolic 
marketing uh he's on the iPhone on the 
Left I'm on my iPad on the right hand 
side I go ahead and launch messages here 
so here I havea conversation go with 
Charles normally we don't stand next to 
eachother we have these conversations 
so most I've talked to you all week 
let's grab lunch after the show I know 
okay so when I send this to them you'll 
notice ashe plays the game it comes in 
right at the top and you can keep on 
playing thegame so it's not 
interrupting him as does his lovely job 
playingI'm on a roll don't bother me 
butat any time he can get right back to 
that message
Oh at anytime I think this might be good 
timeha ha that's so a dick just by 
pullingdowntown that takes him right to 
thisnow as he starts typing see on my 
side where there's the three dots of the
balloon that lets me knowhe's currently 
responding well check maybe some other 
messageswhile he's doing so so then 
when he sendsthe message you see where 
it's cents he gets a little delivered it 
already knows it's been deliveredright 
to my device and when I tap on his 
message it sends a read receipt saying 
rad 11:15 a.m. he knows I've read it so 
readreceipts three

quality and the entire transmission is 
encryptedover-the-air and again I'm on 
my iPad so it supports iPad iPod Touch 
andiPhone thanks jealous 
can't wait forlunch 
soI message and we're actually building 
this on the push notification system 
we've built so we know how to scale this
we have incredible features herein iOS 
reallynice newsstand makes it even 
better to read your newspapers and 
magazinesright on your iPad or iPhone 
great Twitter integration a new 
reminders app you can bePC free if you 
want and the new iMessage application 
and these arejust 10 of the more than 
something for everyone in iOS 5 there's 
other thingslike airplay mirroring you 
can now mirror your entire iPadto write 
to your televisionwirelessly using 
Apple TV 
Wi-Fisync to iTunes before you had 
exactly beforebefore you had to go back 
and plug into your computer to sync and 
now whenyou are charging at night let's 
say your iOS device will automatically
findiTunes over Wi-Fi and sync with it 
and beforeit sinks it'll back itself up 
so you automaticallyget backed up every 
singleday there's also some really nice 
newmultitasking gestures so you can 
just flick right between your apps it's 
really nice we're not only is there's 
something for every one of our customers 
there's something for every one of our
developers some great new development
tools including significant enhancements
toxcode instruments in the simulator 
even core imagewe brought over the 
powerful core imageframe works with Mac 
OS10 - iOS this allows developers to do 
complex imageoperations like redeye 
reduction face detectionright from 
within their apps so you're asking 
yourself when are you getting it and the 
answer is we're giving a developer seed 
to you today 
this is gonna begreat for the 
conference as you learn aboutall the 
newapi's than all the sessions this 
week you can go and use those api's 
immediately using your seed and iOS5 
will ship to allof our customers this 
fall
iOS 5 will support the same devicesthat 
we supported with our last software
update so that's the iPhone 3GS and
iPhone4 all the iPads iPad and iPad 2 
and the third and fourth generation iPod 
Touch and that is iOS 5 
and that is the second ofthe software 
products we wantto tell you about today 
to tell you aboutthe third I like to 
turn it backover to Steve 
so you like everything so far well I'll 
trynot to blow it so I get to talk 
about iCloudwe've been working on this 
for sometime now and we're really 
excitedabout it about ten years ago we 
had one of our most important insights 
and that was that the PC was going to 
become the digital hub foryour digital 
life what does that mean well it meant 
thatthat's where you were going to put 
your digital photos where else wereyou 
going toput them your digital video off 
your digital camcorder and of course
your music right you were going to 
acquire it in the device or potentially
on your Mac and you were going to
basically sync it tothe Mac and 
everything was goingto work fine and it 
didfor the better part of 10 years but 
it's broken down in the last few years 
why well because the devices have 
changedthey now all have music they now 
all have photos they now all have video
and so if I acquire a song I buy it 
righton my iPhone I want to get that to 
my other devicesright I pick up my iPad 
it doesn't havethat song on it so I 
have tosync my iphone to my Mac then I 
have to sync myother devices to the Mac 
to getthat song but then they've 
deposited some photoson the Mac so I 
have to sync the iPhone again with the
Mac to get thosephotos and keeping 
these devices in syncis driving us 
crazy
so we've got a great solutionfor this 
problem and we think this solution is 
our nextbig insight which is we're 
going to demote the PC in theMac to 
just be a device justlike an iPhone an 
iPador an iPod touch and we're going to 
move the digital hub the center of your
digitallife into the cloud because all 
these new devices have communications
built into them they can all talk to the
cloud whenever they wantand so now if I 
getsomething on my iPhone it sends up 
to the cloud immediatelylet's say I 
take some pictureswith it 
those pictures are inthe cloud and they 
are nowpushed down to my devices 
completely automatically and now 
everything isin sync with me not even 
having to think about it I don't even 
have to take thedevices out of my 
pocketI don't have to be near my Mac or 
PCnow some people think the cloud is 
just a hard disk in the sky right and 
you take a bunchof stuff and you put it 
in yourDropbox or your I disk or 
whatever and it transfers it up to the
cloudand stores and then you drag 
whateveryou want back out on your other 
devices we think it's way morethan that 
and we call it iCloud now iCloud stores 
your content inthe cloud and wirelessly 
pushes it to all yourdevices so it 
automatically uploadsit stores it and 
automatically pushesit to all your 
other devices but also it's completely 
integrated with your apps and so 
everythinghappens automatically and 
there's nothing new tolearn it just all 
works
it just works 
now you might askwhy should I believe 
them they're the ones thatbrought me 
mobile me it wasn't our finest hour let 
mejust say that but we learned a lot 
nowthe three core apps in Mobile me or 
contacts calendar and mail three things
we'd obviouslylike kept up to date 
we've thrown them away we've reacted and 
rewritten them from the ground up to be
iCloud apps and we've put them on all of 
ourdevices so as an example in contacts 
when I make anew contact on my iPhone 
it's automatically brought up to the
cloud where it's storedon the cloud 
right the truth is on the cloud and then 
it's automatically pushed downto my 
other devicesso they're all in sync 
it's that easy 
I just update a contacton my iPhone and 
don't eventhink about it and that 
contact is updated on all my other
devices and if I change it on any device 
it's updated on all devices wirelessly 
automatically withoutme doing a thing 
so that's contacts here's calendars
works much thesame way I make a new 
calendar event on my iPhone it's stored
inthe cloud and it's pushed to my other 
devices pretty cool 
we've also added calendar sharing so as
an example ifI'm sharing a few 
calendars with my wife school andsoccer 
calendars let's say right and I add a
newcalendar for a teacher parent 
conference on my phone it's again
automatically pushed up tothe cloud and 
automaticallypush to my wife's iPhone 
if she adds
the key adds an appointment fora soccer 
game againgoes up to the cloud and back 
to my iPhoneit's that simple 
and so calendars has it stores your
calendars in the cloudchanges on any 
deviceor push to all your devices and 
we have shared calendarsand we think 
you're goingto love the new calendars 
it just works
and then we have mail mailis in the 
bestshape of all but it's even better 
nowwe give you a mail accountant at me 
calm your new messages againour push to 
all your devicesand like will use 
through your inboxand folders are all 
kept up to dateon all devices 
so that's mail and no ads
we build productsthat we want for 
ourselvestoo and we just don't want to 
ads so wecan't get there so these are 
the three appsthat form the core of 
mobile me we used to sell them for a 
subscription price of $99 annually as of
today this product ceases to existand 
thosethree apps are 
but we didn't stop therewe've got three 
more apps that we've broughtinto the 
iCloud universe the first is of course 
the App Store the App Store you've 
bought a lotof apps so far and you can 
buy them of coursedirectly on your 
devices
maybe the app youwant isn't on the 
device you've got with youso for all 
your purchase historynow 
you can see it onall your devices even 
if the apps not there and we've added
this button here which is download from 
the cloudand if you want that app on 
that device you just push that button 
and that app is automatically sent to 
that device right and there's no extra 
charge
no extra charge now we've done that for 
your purchase history what about four 
devices you buy in the future well four 
deviceswhen you buy them in the future 
you want to buy Yelp let's say the cloud 
downloads it to all your devicesagain 
at no extra chargeall automatically 
so that's what we'redoing with the App 
Store iBooks same thing you've got your 
purchase historyof all the books you 
bought on any device you want to get it 
on your iPhone se just push the button 
it downloads to that device when you buy 
a new iBooklet's say you want to buy 
this book here thewave it downloads it 
to all yourdevices now and if you're 
readingit on one device let's say 
you're readingit on your iPad and 
you've just got to run you get to a page 
youbookmark that page that bookmark is 
sentup to the cloud and stored and 
again push to all yourother devices so 
maybe you can read anotherthe rest of 
the chapter as an exampleon the train 
towork it all just works 
and now back up we talked about beingPC 
freeScott talked about how you can 
wirelesslybackup your devices daily to 
your PC or yourMac but let's do it to 
the cloud as well for thosepeople that 
want to be completely PC free so we've 
addedwireless backup to the cloud and 
basicallyonce daily we're going to 
backup a lot of your important contents
to the cloud if you ever get a new phone
and have to replace a phone you 
literally type in your Apple ID and 
password and everything will be loaded 
onto that phone automatically and wires 
so we automatically do daily backups to
iCloud over Wi-Fi
webackup your purchase music apps and 
books we backup your camera roll with 
your photos and videos we backup your
device settingsand we backup your app 
data all to the cloud so that isbackup 
and those are three other apps that come 
with iCloud but we couldn't stop there
and so we have a final three apps that 
areamazing the most inventive part of 
iCloudI think and I'd love to tell you 
about the first one is documents in the 
cloud so if I'm on my iPad and I create 
a page as documentsright I create a 
Pages documentand it automatically 
uploadsit and stores it in the cloud 
when I close that document completely 
automaticallyand it then pushes it to 
all the devicesthat I have pages on so 
I can get the document between my
devices and we have put that into Pages 
Numbers and Keynoteas a matter of fact 
the versions wejust released last week 
have this in there and to demonstrate 
what this is like with I work I'd love 
to invite Roger Rosner who's our VP of I 
work up to giveus a quick demo 
thank you Steve
all right let's take a look at how I 
work andiCloud will work together let's 
say you'reworking on a keynote 
presentationon your iPad making a 
beautiful presentation with all those 
awesome keynote graphic effects and 
animations but you're awayfrom home you 
didn'tbring your iPad with you and you 
runinto somebody who wants to see your 
presentationwell the good news is last 
week we shipped I work for iPhone and 
evenbetter for anybody who bought and 
iWork app for your iPad you can download 
that app for your iPhone at no 
additional chargeso let's fire up 
keynote onthis phone this is the first 
time we've run ithere so it's going to 
say hithen it's going to say do you 
want to use iCloud we say yes and 
immediatelyit sees all your keynote 
presentations you've been working onin 
the cloud and starts to download them in 
thebackground to your iPhone so I'll 
openthis one we were just looking at 
and as you cansee it's all there 
it even remembered what slide we were
looking at and if I wantto I can just 
hit play play it right on my iPhone and 
I'd put exactly zero effort into getting 
thatfile over here pretty 
of course all the iWork appsuse iCloud 
so let's take a look at pagesand you 
know what imagine you're out and you
you're inspiredto make some changes to 
a document you've been working on so I'm 
going to move this graphic over here 
maybe Ijust took a photograph that I 
thinkwould be great to spruce up my 
cover page so I'll go tomy camera roll 
I'd serve my graphic 
here's alignment guides to place it and
I'm doneand I stick the phone in my 
pocket and I forget about it and in the 
backgroundiCloud is grabbing all those 
changes and then immediately pushing 
them backdown to my iPad so when I get 
home 
pick up theiPad fire up pages you can 
see in the upper left my document 
thumbnailsalready been updated 
and there are all my editsabsolutely no 
effort on my part and that is how I work 
works with iCloudI think you're going 
to like it
thank you thanks Roger 
and documents in the cloud really
completesour iOS document storage story 
working for 10 years to get rid of the 
filesystem so the user didn't have to 
worry about it when you try to teach
teach somebody how to use aMac the 
easiest of allcomputers to use 
everything's going along fine until you 
hitthe file system and then the 
difficulty is staggering for most people
so we've made it on the iOS devices to 
where you don'tever have to think about 
it the app manages the presentation of 
its own documents just like mail manages
the presentation of its own messagesbut 
the piece thatwe weren't finished with 
was how do wemove those documents 
around to different devices and 
documents in the cloudsolves that 
problem for us apps canstore documents 
in iCloudiCloud pushes those documents 
toa user's devices automatically the 
documents update onall devices when 
changed on any device and we are
releasingAPI 
so
it's reallyeasy to tie your apps into 
iCloud's storage system and again you 
canhave complex documents apps like 
pagesor we've got another storage 
facility for key value dataso as an 
example if you've got an app that just 
track stocks you can just update the key 
value pairsand we'll store that in the 
cloudas well so documents and key value 
data works across all iOS devicesand 
Macs and PCsto 
so we think this isgoing to be pretty 
bigand that is documents in the cloud 
this next one is maybe my favorite one 
and it's called Photo Stream and it's 
goingto bring the cloud to photos how 
many times havewe taken photos on our 
iPhone maybe of our kids in the
afternoon andwanted when we got home to 
share them on an iPadand have to go 
through the process of moving them over 
wouldn't it be great if by the time I 
gothome they were already there on the 
iPad well that's what Photo Stream is 
going to dofor us across all of our 
devicesso again I take photos on any 
device puts it in thecamera roll and 
thatwill be automatically uploaded to 
the cloud where it's storedand 
automatically downloaded to all my other 
devices including in this case a Mac and 
so I've got my photos onmy iPad just 
waiting forme when I get home now in 
additionI can import photos right into 
iPhoto as anexample on the Mac it'll 
upload those to the cloud and do exactly 
the samething with them by pushing them 
down to all my other devices so it's 
apps thatI its photos that I take or 
photosthat I import and we built this 
right intothe apps I hope you've seen 
that as we've gone through this we've
built thisright into the app so there's 
nothingnew to learn so photo stream on 
the iPads photo app we've built it right 
in rightnext to albums we have a button 
called Photo Stream you push it and 
you're looking at the photo stream it's 
that simplethere's not a separate app 
that youhave to go learn it's right 
there in yourPhotos app it's right 
there in your Photos app on youriPhone 
it's just right therewith all your 
other albums there you goPhoto Stream 
on themap on the map we built it right 
into iPhotoand so it's right there on 
the side your photo stream and on a PC 
they don't have aPhotos app so we use 
the pictures folder rightin addition to 
that we've even built it in to Apple TV 
soApple TV Apple TV talks directly over 
theinternet directly to the photo 
stream servers doesn't even gothrough 
your PC talks directlythe photo stream 
serversso you can watch the photos 
righton your Apple TV so one of the 
problems we faced was it will photos are 
large andwill use up all the memory on 
your devices 
there are also large they'll consume
vast amounts ofstorage in our server 
farms so we've came up with a great
scheme we're going to store photos on 
your deviceswe're going to store the 
last thousand photosright let's store 
the lastthousand and any photos you 
wantto keep permanently just move them 
into analbum and they'll stay forever 
but they'll be parading by youthe last 
thousand photographson your Mac or PC 
because we have more storage will store 
allof them you can get rid of them by 
justdeleting them but we'll store all 
of them and on the server will store 
themfor 30 days which is more than 
enough time for all your devices to 
connect and automatically download those 
photos sowe think we've got a great 
system here that's going to move our 
photos aroundamong all of our devices 
evenApple TV so that when I take a 
photo anywhereI can view it on all my 
otherdevices we think this is going to 
be really excitingto demonstrate this 
I've askedTeddy Q or VP of Internet 
services to come on up and giveus a 
demoof photo stream 
thanks toyou yep so I want to take some 
photos to start with now I love cars and 
I happen to have brought one of my 
favorite ones with me here today and 
here it is and we're goingto go to our 
my iPhone and launch the camera app 
Lightning McQueen is looking good 
I love the headlightsand now these 
photos are onmy iPhone but let's go 
look at my iPad now we've built Photo 
Stream right into the Photos app so 
rightnext to albums this photo stream 
and there is the pictures I just
I didn't have to learn anythingnew at 
alland if I want to save them 
permanentlyon my iPad I can just select 
them and move themto an existing album 
or even create a newalbum that's it 
now these photos aren'tjust on my iPad 
they're on all of my deviceslet's move 
over tothe Mac where I've got iPhoto 
running and we've built againPhoto 
Stream right in and there are the photos 
I just took so now when I take a photo 
on one of my devices they automatically 
appearon all of my devices without 
having to do anything at all it's that 
simple
and that'sPhoto Stream 
that wasgood okay not awesome 
so photos you takeor import upload to 
iCloud iCloud pushes them to all your
devices works over Wi-Fi its iCloud 
storeseach photo for 30 days which is 
plentyenough time for all the devices 
to be connected devices store the last 
thousand photosand again you can just 
drag themto an album they stay forever 
and Macs and PCs store all photos so 
we're really reallypleased with Photo 
Stream we think you're going to like it 
a lot
last butnot least is iTunes in the 
cloud 
you know it's the sameold story right 
about I buy something on myiPhone right 
wolfand and it's not on my other 
devices
I grab myipod and I go to listen to 
thatsong I bought yesterday on my 
iPhone it ain't there well the first 
thing we've done again is for the songs 
you've already bought we've added a
purchase button that shows you your
entire purchase history of all the
iTunes songs you bought on any device
you can look at it by all songs or 
recent songs or you canlook at it by 
artist so I'm going to pick Bob Dylan 
here and Ican download any of these 
albums thatI've bought on iTunes to 
thisdevice just by pushing that cloud 
download button or I could go in to one
of them and just download whatever songs 
I want to this device so anything I
boughtI can now download to any of my 
devices at no additional charge which is 
great 
this is the first time we'veseen this 
in the music industryno charge for 
multiple downloads two different devices 
and for the future I flick one switch to 
onand now any song I buy on any device 
again will automatically be downloaded 
to all my devices so when I want to buy 
a songin this case an Adele song it 
will push it to all ofmy devices so to 
give us a demo ofthat again I'd like to 
inviteEddie up thank you thanks Steve 
so I'm on myiPhone and I want to listen 
to a song I'd previously purchased on 
iTunesbut it's not in the music library 
on this device well now I can easily 
just go to the iTunes Music Store 
there's a new purchase tab right on the 
bottom and nowI'm seeing all of the 
purchases I've ever done oniTunes I can 
evenlook at them the songs that I had 
thatare not on this device that I 
previouslypurchased by just tapping 
that buttonnow I'm going to look for a 
Foo Fighterssong I think it's called 
walk 
and there it isand what just tapping 
the iCloud button it downloads to my 
iPhoneagain because I'd previously 
purchasedthis song it's downloading at 
no additional costlet's go ahead and 
play it
just finishing downloading now that's
great but iTunes in the cloud is even
betterlet's see what happens when I 
purchase a new song and if we can bring
up my iPad I'm going to go ahead and 
launch our newmusic player in iOS 5 and 
on my iPhone I'm going to go back to the 
iTunesstore I want to buy a new song 
and Iwant to look at the Bruno Mars's 
new albumI know he has a hit song I 
think it's called lazy lazy song that's 
itwe can preview it that's definitely 
it now I'm going to buy it but before I 
donotice on my iPad I don't have any 
Bruno Mars songs at all so we're going
togo and buy and it's now downloading 
to my iPhoneand in addition there's the 
BrunoMars song 
and of course thequail I just wanna 
make so now when I buy a song on one of 
my devicesit automatically downloads to 
all of my deviceswithout having to sync 
or do any work atall and that's iTunes 
in the cloud
thank you verymuch is this awesome 
so musicpurchase from iTunes high 
quality 256 kilobits AAC and you can 
haveup to 10 devices downloading your 
music to all of them everytime you buy 
it on any deviceiTunes in the cloud so 
these9 apps constitute iCloud and they 
are all free we want we wantevery user 
totake advantage of these and we know 
if we make them free that they'll they
will and we wantpeople to see what 
these devices can really do and what the 
softwarecan really do so we're making 
it free and we're very excited about it 
so that's iCloudit stores your content 
and wirelessly pushes it to all your
devices and it's integrated with your 
appsso everything happens automatically 
so a competitor that doesn't own the 
appsor doesn't have great developers to 
integratewith their apps they can never 
do thisthey can never make it so it 
just works and that's what we've done 
here so how do you get it well when you 
upgradeyour phone or buy a new phone 
with iOS 5 on itall you have to do is 
type inyour Apple ID and password and 
that's itand you'll go to switch that's 
iCloud you can turn it offif you like 
will be turned on by default and you're 
up andrunning we're also going to give 
everybody fivegigabytes of free storage 
for mail documents and backup and that's 
even more than it sounds like because 
we're not countingpurchase music apps 
orbooks towards that five gigabytes 
nor arewe counting photostream 
towards thatfive gigabytes so when can 
you get your hands on this today 
we're going to getyou all a developer 
betatoday and also today we're going to 
make something availableto end-users 
which is the iTunes in the cloud portion 
and it runs on iOS 4.3 it will run on 
allthe supported platforms and when we 
ship it this fall but today we'regoing 
to put it out for4.3 as a beta and 
everyone canget their hands on it and 
run it on their existing existing iPhone 
really excitingand of course we ship 
iCloudconcurrent with shipping iOS 5 
this fallso that is iCloud 
now there'sone more thing a small thing 
it pertains to iTunes in the cloudas 
you recall iTunes in the cloud is just
for the music that you've purchased from 
theiTunes Store now at 14 billion songs 
songs out there 
they've been purchased fromiTunes Music 
Store but you may have some that you 
ripped yourselfand there's three ways 
youcan deal with that one 
you can syncyour new devices over Wi-Fi 
or cable a cable and you only have to 
sync them once just toget that music on 
them and thenyou can rely on iCloud to 
take careof getting all your new 
purchases off iTunes onto that device or 
if it's just a few songs you love you 
don't leave behind you can buy those 
songsthat you'll miss on iTunes we're 
going tooffer a third way which is 
callediTunes Match what is iTunes Match 
well iTunes Match uses the fact that
we've got 18 million songs now in the 
iTunesMusic Store and the chances are 
awfully goodthat we've got the songs in 
our storethat you've ripped and so we 
wrote softwareto scan those CDs the 
ripsi teen on iTunes music and match it 
upwith those songs we have in the store 
right andso we can give that music the 
same benefits as music purchase from
iTunes and it takes just minutes not 
weeksif you have to upload your whole 
library into someLocker in the sky that 
literally takes weeks this takes minutes 
because we're scanning and matching your 
library sowe don't need to upload that 
that largepart of your library and the 
few songs thatremain well we'll upload 
them but with 18 million songs they're 
most likely to have what you've got
in addition iTunes Match will upgrade
those songs that match the 256 kilobits 
AAC
and iTunes Match cost just $24.99 a year 
so if you'vegot a bunch of music if 
you've got a bunchof music that you 
didn't buy from iTunes youcan get all 
the benefitsof the cloud service and 
morein terms of upgrading your music 
for $24.99 a year nowif you look and 
comparethat to some competitors let's 
just look at Appleand Amazon and Google 
your kind of get surprised because again 
the library in the cloudwe scan and 
matchthe other guys you got to upload 
your wholemusic library again it's 
going to take weeks music apps on your 
Macand PC and while you're stuck with a 
web app instead of iTunes upgradeto 256 
kilobits per second theother guys 
aren't upgrading you at all the annual
price for5,000 songs we're $24.99 
Amazon charges you $50 for the storage 
andGoogle hasn't announced their 
pricing yet evenat 20,000 songs we 
charge one flat price Amazon's up to 
announcerpresent 
most ofour customers won't need this 
because they bought a lot of their music 
oniTunes but for those that do 
it's anindustry-leading offering let's 
put itthat way 
so that's iTunes Matchand it goes along 
with freeiTunes in the cloud 
and that's what it isnow 
if you don't think we'reserious about 
this you're wrong this is our third data 
centerthat we just completed it's in 
Maidan North Carolina this is what it 
looks like
it's rather largeit's as eco-friendly 
asyou can make a data center with 
moderntechnology and we're pretty proud 
ofit just to give you a feel for its 
size
see those two littledots on the roof 
those are two peopleright there so it's 
a pretty large place and and it's a full
of stuff a little expensive stuff okay
and we areready we think for for our 
customersto start using iCloud and we 
can't wait toget it in their hands so I 
cloud is the thirdthing we want to talk 
about today I hope you like all the 
three thingsthat we've unveiled this 
morning and againwe've got a great week 
plan for youwith 5200 attendees over 
over a thousand Appleengineers here all 
week so please askus for any help you
